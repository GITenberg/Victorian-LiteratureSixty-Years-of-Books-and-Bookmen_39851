<h2 class="p6">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>

<p>Asked by a kindly publisher to add one more
to the Jubilee volumes which commemorate the
sixtieth year of the Queen's reign, I am pleased
at the opportunity thus afforded me of gathering
up a few impressions of pleasant reading
hours. "Every age," says Emerson, "must write
its own books; or rather, each generation for the
next succeeding. The books of an older period
will not fit this." It is true, of course, and as a
result the popular favourite of to-day is well-nigh
forgotten to-morrow. In reading the critical
journals of thirty years ago it is made quite
clear that they contain few judgments which would
be sustained by a consensus of critical opinion
to-day. Whether time will deal as hardly with the
critical judgments of to-day we may not live to see.
I have no ambition to put this book to a personal
test. So far as it has any worth at all it is
meant to be bibliographical and not critical. It
aspires to furnish the young student, in handy form,
with as large a number of facts about books as can
be concentrated in so small a volume. That this
has been done under the guise of a consecutive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
narrative, and not in the form of a dictionary, is
merely for the convenience of the writer.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to say as little as possible
about living poets and novelists. With the historians
and critics the matter is of less importance.
To say that Mr Samuel Rawson Gardiner has
written a useful history, or that Professor David
Masson's "Life of Milton" is a valuable contribution
to biographical literature, will excite no
antagonism. But to attempt to assign Mr W. B.
Yeats a place among the poets, or "Mark Rutherford"
a position among the prose writers of the
day, is to trespass upon ground which it is wiser
to leave to the critics who write in the literary
journals from week to week. It was not possible
to ignore all living writers. I have ignored as
many as I dared.</p>

<p>It was my intention at first to devote a chapter
to Sixty Years of American Literature. But for
that task an Englishman who has paid but one
short visit to the United States has no qualification.
He can write of American literature only as
seen through English eyes. That is to see much
of it, it is true. Few Americans realise the enormous
influence which the literature of their own
land has had upon this country. Probably the most
read poet in England during the sixty years has
been Longfellow. Probably the most read novel
has been "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Among people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
who claim to be distinctly literary Hawthorne has
been all but the favourite novelist, Washington
Irving not the least popular of essayists, and
Emerson the most invigorating moral influence.
In my youth "The Wide, Wide World" and
"Queechy" were in everybody's hands; as the
stories of Bret Harte, William Dean Howells,
Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Frank Stockton, Henry
James, and Mary Wilkins are to-day. Apart from
Dickens, nearly all our laughter has come from
Mark Twain and Artemus Ward.</p>

<p>In history, we in England have read Prescott
and Motley; in poetry we have read Walt Whitman,
William Cullen Bryant, John Greenleaf
Whittier, and, above all, James Russell Lowell,
who endeared himself to us alike as a poet, a
critic, and in his own person when he represented
the United States at the Court of St James's.
Lastly I recall the delight with which as a boy I
read the "Autocrat of the Breakfast Table," and
the joy with which as a man I visited the author,
Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his pleasant study
in Beacon Street, Boston. These and many other
writers have made America and the Americans
very dear to Englishmen, and this in spite of
much wild and foolish talk in the journals of the
two countries.</p>

<p>I have to thank Mr William Mackenzie, the
well-known publisher of Glasgow, for kindly letting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
me draw upon some articles which I wrote for his
"National Cyclopædia" ten years ago, and upon
the literary section, which he and his editor, Mr
John Brabner, permitted me to contribute at that
time to a book entitled "The Victorian Empire."
I have also to thank my friends, Dr Robertson
Nicoll and Mr L. F. Austin, for kindly reading
my proof-sheets, Mr Edward Clodd for valuable
suggestions, and Mr Sydney Webb, a friend of
old student days, for reading the chapter which
treats briefly of sociology and economics.</p>

<p>A compilation of this kind can scarcely hope to
escape the defects of most such enterprises&mdash;errors
both of date and of fact. I shall be glad to receive
corrections for the next edition.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center b15">The Poets</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">When Queen Victoria came to the throne in
1837, most of the great poets who had been
inspired by the French Revolutionary epoch were
dead. Keats had died in Rome in 1821, Shelley
was drowned in the Gulf of Spezzia in 1822, Byron
died at Missolonghi in 1824, Scott at Abbotsford
in 1832, and Coleridge at Highgate in 1834.
Southey was Poet Laureate, although Wordsworth
held a paramount place, recognised on all hands
as the greatest poet of the day.</p>

<p class="p2">The gulf which separates the <b>Southey </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1774-1843</b></span> of the
laureateship from the Southey who presents himself
to our judgment to-day is almost impossible
to bridge over. Southey, as the average bookman
thinks of him now, is the author of a "Life of
Nelson" and of one or two lyrics and ballads.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The "Life of Nelson" is constantly republished for
an age keenly bent on Nelson worship, but for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
exacting it has been superseded by at least two
biographies from living authors.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That Southey
should live mainly by a book which was merely
a publisher's commission, and not by the works
which he and his contemporaries deemed immortal,
is one of the ironies of literature.
Southey's "Cowper" is a much better biography
than his "Nelson," but in Cowper the world has
almost ceased to be interested. It does not
now read "Table Talk" and "The Task" any
more than it reads "Thalaba" and "Madoc,"
although every cultivated household of sixty
years ago could talk freely of these poems.
There will probably be a revival of interest in
Cowper. It is safe to assume that there will
never be a revival of interest in Southey, and that
his very lengthy poems are doomed to oblivion.</p>

<p class="p2">And yet it is interesting to note where
Southey's contemporaries placed him. Shelley
thought "Thalaba" magnificent, and its influence
was marked in "Queen Mab." Coleridge spoke
of its "pastoral charm." Landor found "Madoc"
superb. Scott said that he had read it three or
four times with ever-increasing admiration. It
kept Charles James Fox out of bed till the small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
hours! But inexorable time has declared that
these poems have no permanent place in literature.
Time, however, has left us a kindly memory of
Southey the man. Sara Coleridge's assertion that
he was "on the whole the best man she had ever
known," tallies with the judgment of many others
of his contemporaries&mdash;who did not come into
collision with his relentless prejudices.</p>

<p class="p2">Relentless prejudice was equally a characteristic
of Southey's greater successor as Poet Laureate.
<b>William Wordsworth </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1770-1850</b></span> had written all the poems
by which he will live when the Queen came to
the throne, but further recognition awaited the
author of "Lyrical Ballads" and "Laodamia" in
the thirteen years of his life that were yet to
come. It was in 1839 that Keble, as Professor of
Poetry at Oxford, welcomed Wordsworth when he
received the honorary degree of D.C.L. with the
eulogy that he had "shed a celestial light upon
the affections, the occupations and the piety of
the poor." In 1842 he obtained an annuity from
the Civil List, and in the following year he succeeded
Southey as laureate. The mere fact,
however, that Wordsworth wrote nothing of importance
in the present reign does not permit of
his dismissal as a pre-Victorian author. His real
influence, splendid and serene, was made upon
the age which is passing away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>He found us when the age had bound</p>
<p>Our souls in its benumbing round;</p>
<p>He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.</p>
</div>

<p>During the period in which Wordsworth's poems
were coming from the press he was scoffed at
alike by Byron and by the authors of "Rejected
Addresses," and they appealed to a sympathetic
audience. Coleridge had, indeed, praised him
generously enough, but the author of "The Ode
to Duty" knew nothing of the enthusiastic partisanship
which was to be his lot in the later years
of his life, and for more than a quarter of a century
after his death. I have before me two books
which will serve to indicate the high-water-mark of
Wordsworth's popularity. One is a volume of
selections from his poems, which was edited by
Mr Matthew Arnold,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the other, a volume of
Transactions of the Wordsworth Society, which
was privately issued to the members. In his little
volume of "Selections" Mr Arnold, then recognised
on all hands as our most important living critic,
insisted upon Wordsworth's pre-eminence in poetry,
placing him indeed on a level with Shakspere and
Milton, and assigning to Byron and Shelley a
secondary rank.</p>

<p>Mr Arnold, as events proved, only echoed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
pervading sentiment. The Wordsworth Society was
founded, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Dean of St Paul's, the Lord Chief Justice of England,
the then American Minister&mdash;Mr Lowell&mdash;and
a number of distinguished literary men, among
its members. The Transactions of that Society
give evidence that among the thoughtful men and
women of the last decade Wordsworth was by far
the strongest influence, that he was not merely a
literary tradition, but that he was a vital force in the
minds and hearts of nearly all the most interesting
people of the period. Students of to-day,
however, will be well content to read Wordsworth
only in Matthew Arnold's "Selections." Here they
will find him as a sonneteer proclaiming liberty with
scarcely less zeal and power than Milton. They
will find him as the sympathetic friend of the poor
and of the oppressed. To be dead to the charm
of Matthew Arnold's "Selections from Wordsworth"
is to care nothing for poetry. To appreciate with
any measure of enthusiasm the twelve volumes of
Wordsworth's collected writings is equally to have
one's sense of true poetry deadened and destroyed.
We have no time now for "The Excursion" and
"The Prelude." We have less for Wordsworth's
"Ecclesiastical Sonnets" and "The Borderers."
For his copious prose moralizings one has no
toleration whatever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">It is not easy to judge whether <b>Alfred Tennyson </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1892</b></span>
will ever cease to retain the very wide hold upon
the public which was his for at least thirty years
prior to his death, and which is his to-day. The
poems of Tennyson might be read by succeeding
generations of Englishmen if only for their
exquisite purity of style. Music he has also
in abundance. In "Harold," "Queen Mary,"
and his other plays there is no great gift of characterisation,
and these assuredly will go the way of
Southey's more ambitious poems. But in "Maud"
Tennyson caught the social aspiration of his time
with singular insight. The world, he pleaded&mdash;and
England in particular&mdash;was given over to money-getting.
The capitalist was more tyrannical than
the old, expiring slave-owner. Even peace was a
mere word. There was a worse tyranny than that
which left men for dead on the battle-field. There
was the tyranny which ground them to dust for a
bare pittance in mill and factory. Tennyson never
wrote with greater force or with more perfect
dramatic and lyric art, and his poem is as striking
and effective to-day as at the time of its publication
in 1855.</p>

<p class="p2">Lord Tennyson&mdash;for the Poet Laureate accepted
a peerage in 1890&mdash;won the hearts of a wider audience
by "In Memoriam," and of a still larger one
by "The Idylls of the King." "In Memoriam," a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
lengthy elegy on his college friend, Arthur Hallam,
touched the great religious public of England.
The poem reflected a certain transcendentalism of
view which was fast becoming fashionable.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"There lives more faith in honest doubt,</p>
<p>Believe me, than in half the creeds"</p>
</div>

<p>was, in fact, more and more the prevailing tone
among all phases of Protestantism where a few years
earlier the exact opposite had been insisted upon.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most agreeable pictures which our
literary period affords is offered by the friendship
between Lord Tennyson and Robert Browning.
The two men were not seldom compared;
each had his partisans, and each his enthusiastic
disciples. Neither from a social nor
from a literary point of view would they seem
to have had much in common. Browning was
a regular diner-out, he appeared systematically at
every picture-gallery, and at every public entertainment,
and in all these things he was keenly interested:
he loved society. Lord Tennyson, on
the other hand, lived a retired life in one or other
of his country houses. He was morbidly sensitive
to the attentions of the crowd, and amusing stories
are told of his desire to avoid the "vulgar" gaze.
Considered as literary men, the contrast between
these poets was greater. Tennyson's language was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
dainty, simple, full of grace; his characters monotonous,
lacking in vigour. Browning wrote with
rugged force, and sometimes with an obscurity
which left the reader bewildered. But his gift of
characterisation was superb, and his men and
women for individuality are comparable only to
those of Shakspere. The hearts of all of us go out
to Tennyson when we think of the music of his
verses, of his gifts of natural description, his fine
and captivating imagination; but our hearts and
our intellects go out to Browning, as to one who has
enshrined our best thoughts, who has touched all our
deepest emotions. It is true that half of Browning's
sixteen volumes are flatly incomprehensible to the
majority of us; but the other half are equal in bulk
to the whole of Lord Tennyson's writings, and
quite free from any suspicion of obscurity. The
"Ring and the Book" is not obscure. It is
an exciting story, dramatically told. So also are
the poems called "Men and Women," and the
"Dramatic Idyls." "Luria," "In a Balcony," "A
Blot in the 'Scutcheon," are as readable as railway
novels. And yet Browning had, and has, none of
the popularity of Tennyson. The one writer sold
by thousands, and his financial reward was probably
unprecedented in poetry; the other had but a small
audience, an audience which never approached to
one-third of his rival's. Notwithstanding all this,
it is pleasing to note that the two poets loyally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
esteemed one another, as the dedication of some
of their books conspicuously proves.</p>

<p class="p2">To write thus early of <b>Robert Browning </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1812-1889</b></span> is to
anticipate in the literary record. "Pauline," the
poet's first poem, was published, it is true, in 1833;
and that and successive poems were accepted by
good critics as the work of a true poet. Nevertheless,
Browning had to fight his way as no poet of
equal merit has ever had to do, and it was very
late indeed in the Victorian epoch that he became
more than the poet of a limited circle. One there
was, certainly, who appreciated his work from the
first with no common fervour, for the world has
long been familiar with the statement that a reference
by Elizabeth Barrett in "Lady Geraldine's
Courtship" first brought the two poets together in
1845&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"From Browning some 'Pomegranate'</p>
<p>Which, if cut deep down the middle,</p>
<p>Shows a heart within blood-tinctured,</p>
<p>Of a veined humanity."</p>
</div>

<p>They were married a year later. As exemplifying
the condescension of their earlier contemporaries
it is interesting to note Wordsworth's observation
on the event&mdash;and Wordsworth had no humour&mdash;"So,
Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett have
gone off together! Well, I hope they may understand
each other&mdash;nobody else could!" Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Granville, who was staying in Florence when a son
was born to the poets there in 1849, was still
more amusing although equally uncritical. "Now
there are not two incomprehensibles but three
incomprehensibles," he said.</p>

<p class="p2">It cannot be charged against <b>Elizabeth Barrett
Browning </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1806-1861</b></span> that she was in the least incomprehensible.
Her "Cry of the Children," "Cowper's
Grave," and "Aurora Leigh," have the note of
extreme simplicity. Nor is obscurity a characteristic
of "Sonnets from the Portuguese," which
were not translations, but so named to disguise a
wife's devotion to her husband. "Aurora Leigh"
she styled a "novel in verse," and it was in
fact a very readable romance, marked by that
zest for social reform which characterised the
period.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "The most mature of my works, and
the one into which my highest convictions upon
Life and Art have entered," she wrote of it.</p>

<p>After the marriage the pair lived principally at
Florence. In their Florentine home&mdash;Casa Guidi&mdash;"Aurora
Leigh," and "Casa Guidi Windows"
were written, and here Mrs Browning died in
June 1861. One may still see the house upon
which the Florentine municipality has inscribed
a tablet in gratitude for the "golden ring" of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
poetry with which the enthusiastic woman poet
had attempted to unite England and Italy.</p>

<p class="p2">Another great Florentine by adoption, <b>Walter
Savage Landor </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1775-1864</b></span>, came to live near the Brownings.
His rugged nature must have been not a little
soothed by the gentle little woman with "a soul
of fire enclosed in a shell of pearl." Landor was
educated at Rugby, at Ashbourne, and at Trinity
College, Oxford. From Rugby he was removed to
avoid expulsion, and at Oxford he was rusticated.
All this was the outcome of an excitable temperament,
which led in later life to domestic complications,
and to exile from his family in Florence.
It found no reflection in his many beautiful works.
As a poet, however, Landor holds no considerable
rank, although here placed among them. "Gebir"
was published in 1798 and "Count Julian" in
1812. Both these lengthy poems have received
the rapturous praise of authoritative critics, De
Quincey even declaring that Count Julian was a
creation worthy to rank beside the Prometheus
of Æschylus and Milton's Satan. Southey insisted
indeed that Landor had written verses "of which
he would rather have been the author than of
any produced in our time." But Landor's poems,
although obtainable in his collected works, and
published in selections, command no audience
to-day. With his prose the case is otherwise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
There is little in the six volumes of "Imaginary
Conversations," or in the two volumes of "Longer
Prose Works," that does not merit attention
alike for style and matter. "Give me," he
says in one of his prefaces, "ten accomplished
men for readers and I am content." Landor
has all accomplished men for readers now.
And all are at one with the critic who said
that, "excepting Shakspere, no other writer has
furnished us with so many delicate aphorisms of
human nature." Mr Swinburne's expression of
veneration is well known.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The connecting link between Landor and his
young admirer is sufficiently apparent. In genuine
accomplishment, the imaginative literature of our
era has produced no one comparable to Landor,
save only <b>Algernon Charles Swinburne</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1837- </b></span>. Mr Swinburne
has written well in several languages other
than his own. In his own he has written tragedies
of wider purpose than those of Tennyson, of equal
insight with those of Browning. He has written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
noble sonnets, lyrics of exquisite melody, and
one poem, "Ave atque Vale," which takes rank
among the imperishable elegies of our literature.
He has abundant spontaneity and a marvellous
gift of rhythm. Added to all this, he is a critic of
almost unequalled learning and distinction. He
was the first to give adequate recognition to the
poetic genius of Matthew Arnold and Emily Brontë.
He knows Elizabethan literature with remarkable
thoroughness, and he knows the literature of many
ages and many lands better than most of the professors.
His appreciation of Charles Lamb endears
him to English readers, and his eulogies of Victor
Hugo command the respect of Frenchmen. A
great poet and a great prose writer, Mr Swinburne
is perhaps the most distinguished literary figure
of our day. Only when in the distant years his
country has lost him, will a great folly be generally
recognised. Why, it will be asked, did we
not spontaneously call for him&mdash;arch democrat
and arch rebel though he may have been&mdash;as the
only possible successor to Lord Tennyson as Poet
Laureate?</p>

<p class="p2">It has been said that Mr Swinburne was the first
to recognise the great poetical gifts of <b>Matthew
Arnold </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1822-1888</b></span>. Writing in the Fortnightly Review in
1867,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he remarked that the fame of Mr Matthew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Arnold had for some years been almost exclusively
the fame of a prose writer. "Those students," he
continued, "could hardly find hearing, who with
all esteem and enjoyment of his essays ... retained
the opinion that, if justly judged, he must
be judged by his verse and not by his prose."
The view that Arnold excelled as a prose writer
continued to hold sway for many years after
Mr Swinburne wrote, and it was current up to
the date of Arnold's death. "Literature and
Dogma" and "God and the Bible," the former
of which first appeared in 1873, excited an
extraordinary amount of attention, and helped
largely to modify the religious beliefs of many
men and women now rapidly approaching middle
age. The son of a famous clergyman, Dr Thomas
Arnold of Rugby, Matthew Arnold was a product
of that Broad Church movement which Dr
Arnold had helped largely to inspire. A fellow-pupil
of Dr Stanley, Dean of Westminster, Arnold
went further than the Dean in his opposition to
supernaturalism in religion, though he stopped short
of the fiery antagonism which another eminent
Anglican churchman, Bishop Colenso, displayed
towards the miraculous stories of the Old Testament.
But far more than Stanley or Colenso did
he influence the Protestant Christianity of his day.
This, however, scarcely enters into the discussion
of Matthew Arnold the poet. More akin to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
side of Arnold's life is his literary criticism. For
many years he held in this field a well nigh
undisputed throne. For a time he was Professor
of Poetry at Oxford. But his influence came
mainly through a volume called "Essays in
Criticism" (1865), of which it is not too much
to say that the paper entitled "The Function of
Criticism at the Present Time," gave a new impulse
to all students of books. Here and elsewhere
Arnold emphasised the opinion that not only a fine
artistic instinct but a vast amount of knowledge,
admitting of comparisons, is necessary as the
equipment of a critic. Criticism he defined as "a
disinterested endeavour to learn and propagate the
best that is known and thought in the world."
Matthew Arnold had other claims as a prose
writer. His appeal for the study of Celtic literature
initiated and encouraged a revival of
learning in Wales and in Ireland; and his books
and essays on Education&mdash;for his main income
for many years was derived from his salary as an
Inspector of Schools&mdash;did much to further the
cause which his brother-in-law, Mr W. E. Forster,
began with the great Education Act of 1870.</p>

<p>But it is as a poet, as Mr Swinburne foretold, that
Matthew Arnold lives in literature. It is strange
to some of us to note how largely the bulk of his
prose work has dropped out of the memory of the
younger generation. The diligent collector possesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
some forty-five volumes of Mr Arnold's
writings; but although there has been a cheap
reprint of many of these, it is only by his collected
poems that he is widely known to-day.
Mr Swinburne, in the essay to which I have referred,
tells of the joy with which, as a schoolboy,
he came upon a copy of "Empedocles on Etna."
He must then have been about fifteen years of
age, as "Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems
by A" was published in 1852. It contained
"Tristram and Iseult," "Stanzas in Memory of
the Author of 'Obermann,'" and many now accepted
favourites. "The Strayed Reveller" by
"A" was a still earlier volume of anonymous
verse (1849); and, in 1853, "Poems" by Matthew
Arnold made the poet known by name to a small
circle. A substantial recognition as a poet did not
however fall to Matthew Arnold while he lived. His
career is, indeed, a striking example of the fact that
our views of contemporary literature require to be
revised every decade. Ten years ago everyone
was discussing Matthew Arnold's views concerning
Isaiah and St Paul, and the Nonconformists,
whom he chaffed good-humouredly, have reconstructed
many of their beliefs through a study of
his works. People were excited by his views on
education and by his views on literature, but not
by his poetry. To-day his poetry is all of him
that remains, and its charm is likely to soothe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the more strenuous minds among us for at least
another generation, and perhaps for all time.</p>

<p class="p2">In "Thyrsis," a striking elegy on <b>Arthur Hugh
Clough</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-1861</b></span>, Arnold struck a note which has only
Milton's "Lycidas" and Shelley's "Adonais" to
call forth comparisons. Clough was not a Keats,
but he was a more considerable personage than
Milton's friend, and indeed he has been persistently
underrated by many men of letters. Not
indeed by all. "We have a foreboding," said
Mr Lowell, "that Clough will be thought a
hundred years hence, to have been the truest
expression in verse of the moral and intellectual
tendencies of the period in which he lived."
Clough was the son of a cotton merchant of
Liverpool, and he was a pupil of Dr Arnold at
Rugby. He gained a Balliol scholarship, and went
into residence in 1837. The coming years brought
doubts and distractions, religious and political, and
Clough parted from Oxford. His most famous
poem, "The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich," was
published in 1848. In 1852 he sailed to Boston
in the same ship that carried Thackeray and Lowell.
Emerson, who had met him in England, welcomed
him there. Travelling through Europe for his
health, he died of paralysis in Florence in 1861.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The catalogue of great English poets of the
period is completed with the names of Rossetti
and Morris. Perhaps there is no more romantic
figure in modern literature than <b>Dante Gabriel
Rossetti </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828-1882</b></span>, although he has suffered cruelly from the
biographer. His father, Gabriele, was an Italian
exile, a critic of Dante, a teacher of Italian in
London. His mother was a sister of the notorious
Polidori, whose charlatanry is remembered wherever
an interest in Lord Byron prevails.</p>

<p>The younger Rossetti had relatives&mdash;a brother,
William Michael, who has written verses, criticisms,
and a ponderous biography of Gabriel; and a sister,
<b>Maria Francesca Rossetti </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1827-1876</b></span>, whose "Shadow of
Dante" makes good reading for admirers of the
great Florentine, and, indeed, may be recommended
to every English student of Dante. Another sister,
<b>Christina Georgina Rossetti </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1830-1894</b></span>, wrote many books.
She will live by her "Goblin Market" (1862), and
by numerous short poems. Books of the type of
"Called to be Saints" and "The Face of the
Deep: A Commentary on the Revelation," have
also won her much affection and admiration from
religious sympathisers. She was not responsible
for "Maude" and "New Poems," inadequate
works which her brother thought fit to publish
after her death. They are practically worthless.</p>

<p>Dante Rossetti was a considerable painter as
well as a poet. His name is written large in that pre-Raphaelite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
movement which gave him for associates
Mr Holman Hunt and Sir John Millais. The
movement, which had Mr John Ruskin for its
literary champion, when reduced to simple statement,
meant a harking back to early mediæval
art. Sir John Millais and Mr Holman Hunt
speedily abandoned this position, and Rossetti
himself was never a pre-Raphaelite in any real
sense. The pre-Raphaelites issued in 1850 a
journal under the editorship of Rossetti's brother,
and to the <i>Germ</i>, as it was called, Rossetti contributed
his poem, "The Blessed Damozel," and
a story, "Hand and Soul." To the <i>Germ</i> also,
Thomas Woolner (1825-1892), the sculptor, contributed
the poems of "My Beautiful Lady."</p>

<p class="p2">One epoch in the life of Rossetti was his introduction
to Mr Ruskin, and another was his first
acquaintance with William Morris. Ruskin bought
his pictures with characteristic generosity, and
further assisted Rossetti to publish "The Early
Italian Poets" (1861), afterwards reprinted as
"Dante and his Circle" (1874). William Morris
introduced Rossetti to his Oxford friends, including
Mr Swinburne, and to the <i>Oxford and Cambridge
Magazine</i>, in which many of his finest poems
were published. After his wife's death, from an
overdose of laudanum in 1862, Rossetti moved to
Queen's House, Cheyne Walk, where for a time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
had for associates in payment of rent Mr Swinburne
and Mr George Meredith, though the latter
never actually lived in the house. From that
time to his death he published many important
poems&mdash;ballads of singular power like "The White
Ship," "The King's Tragedy," and "Sister Helen,"
and the many splendid sonnets of "The House of
Life." The two volumes of Rossetti's collected
works must always command readers. Rossetti
died at Birchington-on-Sea, and a simple tomb in
the churchyard marks his grave.</p>

<p class="p2">The name of <b>William Morris</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1834-1896</b></span> closes the list
of Victorian poets of the first rank. Morris
was as versatile as Rossetti. He touched many
branches of Art with remarkable success. Now
he was designing wall-papers, and became a successful
manufacturer in this branch of commerce:
now he was indefatigable in printing notable
books in English literature from a type which he
had himself selected. The wall-paper has given a
new direction to the decoration of English houses,
and the Kelmscott Press has added many beautiful
books to our libraries, and given an impetus to a
revival of taste in printing. This was but a part
of Morris's life. Although a rich man, he was a
vigorous lecturer on behalf of Socialism, and wrote
many books, such as, for example: "The Dream
of John Ball" (1888), and "News from Nowhere"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
(1891), in support of his ideals. From the appearance
of his "Defence of Guenevere" (1858),
and "Life and Death of Jason" (1867), he
was always publishing, and his translations from
Homer, Virgil, and Scandinavian literature make
a small library by themselves. But a practical
handbook to Victorian literature needs but to
mention one of his books. "The Earthly Paradise"
(1868-70), will live as long as a love of good
story-telling remains to us. The tales are told by
twenty-four travellers who desire to find the earthly
paradise, and the book opens as do the Canterbury
Tales with a Prologue. The lyrical introduction
is one of the most quotable things in our
later literature:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Of Heaven or Hell I have no power to sing,</p>
<p>I cannot ease the burden of your fears,</p>
<p>Or make quick-coming death a little thing,</p>
<p>Or bring again the pleasure of past years,</p>
<p>Nor for my words shall ye forget your tears,</p>
<p>Or hope again for aught that I can say,</p>
<p>The idle singer of an empty day.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time,</p>

<p>To those who in the sleepy region stay,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Folk say, a wizard to a Northern King</p>

<p>While still, unheard, but in its wonted way,</p>
<p>Piped the drear wind of that December day."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>William Morris has not seldom been confused
with a writer with whom he had nothing in common
but the name. <b>Sir Lewis Morris</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1833-</b></span>, a Welsh
squire, and candidate for Parliament, has stood
for convention as decisively as William Morris
has stood against it. His "Songs of Two Worlds"
(1871-5), and "Epic of Hades" (1876), brought
him a considerable popularity, which "A Vision
of Saints," and later books have not been able
to maintain. Another literary knight of our time
who has secured a large share of public attention
through his verse is <b>Sir Edwin Arnold</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1832-</b></span>, whose
"Light of Asia" interpreted to many the story of
Buddha's career. A poem upon Christ and
Christianity "The Light of the World," owed the
fact of its smaller success to the greater familiarity
of the public with its main incidents. Sir Edwin
Arnold has won other laurels as a traveller and as
a journalist.</p>

<p class="p2">Some of the best poetry of the era has been
produced by writers whose principal achievements
are in the realm of prose. The Brontës,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Charles Kingsley, George Meredith, and George
Eliot&mdash;to name but a few&mdash;all wrote verse which
must ultimately have secured attention had they
not made great reputations as novelists.</p>

<p>Assuredly, the three most successful poems in
Victorian literature, of that portion of it which is
already passing into oblivion, are "Proverbial
Philosophy," "Festus," and "Philip Van Artevelde."
The "Proverbial Philosophy" of <b>Martin
Farquhar Tupper</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1810-1889</b></span> created an excitement in literary
and non-literary circles, which it is difficult for the
present generation to comprehend. It is true that
when it was first published, in 1838, it was greeted
by the <i>Athenaeum</i> as "a book not likely to please
beyond the circle of a few minds as eccentric as
the author's." In spite of this, it sold in thousands
and hundreds of thousands; it went through over
nine hundred editions in England, and five
hundred thousand copies at least were sold in
America. It was translated into French, German,
and many other tongues; its author was a popular
hero, although of his later books, including "Ballads
for the Times," "Raleigh, his Life and
Death," and "Cithara," the very names are
by this time forgotten. Of "Proverbial Philosophy"
itself there are few enough copies in
demand to-day, and it is difficult for us to
place ourselves in the position of those who felt
its charm. What to the early Victorian Era
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
was counted for wisdom, and piety, and even
for beauty, counts to the present age for mere
commonplace verbiage. Tupper's name has taken
a place in our language as the contemptuous
synonym for a poetaster. "Festus," on the other
hand, although not read to-day, has always commanded
respectful attention. Its author, <b>Philip James Bailey</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1816-</b></span>,
wrote "Festus" in its first form, at
the age of twenty, and it was published in 1839.
The book was enlarged again and again, till it
reached to three times its original length. It may
be that this enlargement has had something to do
with its fate. "Festus" was frequently compared
to the best work of Goethe and of Mr Browning.
Even a more pronounced recognition accrued to
the dramatic poems of <b>Sir Henry Taylor</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1800-1886</b></span>, and
more particularly to "Philip Van Artevelde"
(1834), which was described by the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> as "the noblest effort in the true old
taste of our English historical drama, that has
been made for more than a century," and
which attracted the keenest attention of all Sir
Henry Taylor's contemporaries. His entertaining
"Autobiography" has told us that Taylor, who
was an important official at the Colonial Office,
knew all the famous men of his time.</p>

<p class="p2">Women have occupied no small share in the
literary history of the past sixty years, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
it is in fiction that their most enduring triumphs
have been secured. The most popular women
poets, next in order to Mrs Browning, have been
Eliza Cook and Jean Ingelow. <b>Eliza Cook</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1818-1889</b></span> wrote
for the most part the kind of verses which would
now be rejected by the editor of the Poet's Corner
of a provincial newspaper. She would be little
more than a vague memory, were it not for
"The Old Arm-Chair"; but she has other
claims to consideration. In the forties and the
fifties <i>Eliza Cook's Journal</i> was one of the most
prominent publications of the day, and it did
much for the cause of literature and philanthropy.
<b>Jean Ingelow</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-1897</b></span> survived, as did Eliza Cook,
to see her verse well-nigh forgotten, and yet it is
stated that two hundred thousand copies of her
poems have been sold in America alone. Miss
Ingelow, who was born in Boston, Lincolnshire,
and died in London, will live in anthologies by
her ballad, "High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire,"
by a song in "Supper at the Mill," and
by sundry short poems.</p>

<p class="p2">A certain brighter and more humorous kind of
verse had its beginnings with Thomas Hood and the
author of "The Ingoldsby Legends." <b>Thomas Hood</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1798-1845</b></span>
has endeared himself to the whole reading world
by his "Song of the Shirt" (1844); and his "Dream
of Eugene Aram" (1829) is not less familiar. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
in addition to this he had an abundance of wit
and drollery side by side with pathos and tenderness,
which will always make a splendid tradition
and a great inspiration. Hood was a journalist.
His prototype, <b>Richard Harris Barham</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1788-1845</b></span>, was an
Anglican clergyman. His pseudonym of Thomas
Ingoldsby calls up memories of some of the quaintest
and drollest verse ever written. "The Ingoldsby
Legends" were first contributed to <i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>,
and afterwards collected in volumes. "The
Jackdaw of Rheims" is the most popular. Barham's
once successful novel, "My Cousin Nicholas," is
now all but forgotten.</p>

<p class="p2">The most famous successors of Hood and Barham
have been Calverley and Mr Austin Dobson.
<b>Charles Stuart Calverley</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1831-1884</b></span> wrote "Fly Leaves" and
"Verses and Translations." Mr Dobson has published,
in addition to many valuable prose works,
the exquisite "Vignettes in Rhyme" and "Proverbs
in Porcelain," which, with Mr Andrew Lang's
"Ballades in Blue China," form a dainty contribution
to the lighter literature of the epoch.</p>

<p class="p2">A determination to say as little as possible concerning
writers still young in years, though already
famous, will make, it may be, my summary of
Victorian poetry seem inadequate to many. Mr
Traill, a discerning critic, has specified some hundred
or more "minor poets" who flourish to-day! But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
it cannot be doubted that the minor poet of our era,
with his excellent technique, his deep feeling, and his
high-minded impulsiveness, is separated by an immense
gulf from the minor poet of an earlier period.
The Pyes and the Hayleys, who were famous in
an age when criticism was less of an art, had little
enough of the real poetical faculty. That faculty can
scarcely be denied to the hundred or more of living
bards who now claim the suffrages of the poetry-loving
reader. It cannot be denied also to many
men who have passed away during the present
era&mdash;to Alexander Smith and Sydney Dobell in
one period, and to Coventry Patmore and
James Thomson in another. <b>Alexander Smith</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1830-1867</b></span>
was an industrious essayist as well as a poet.
Tennyson and Mrs Browning concurred in their
esteem of Smith as a poet "whose works show
fancy, and not imagination"; and this might with
truth be said of too many of the minor bards, and,
indeed, constitutes the dividing line. Sydney
Yendys, under which pseudonym <b>Sydney Dobell</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1824-1874</b></span>
co-operated with Smith in "Sonnets on the War"
(1855), was a poet of similar temperament.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Coventry Patmore</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1823-1896</b></span> is known to the many
through his "Angel in the House," a poem upon
domestic bliss which breathed a note not always
sincere, but to which Mr Ruskin assured a certain
popularity through effective quotation in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
"Sesame and Lilies." A certain ecstatic band of
admirers attached more importance to Patmore's
"Unknown Eros." These admirers spoilt him by
adulation. He probably looked forward with the
same keen assurance to the verdict of posterity
as did Southey; and posterity it is all but certain
will be as ruthless in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p class="p2">Patmore's life was one of luxury and independence.
Quite the reverse was the fate of <b>James
Thomson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1834-1882</b></span>, whose great poem, "The City of
Dreadful Night," was published in Mr Charles
Bradlaugh's <i>National Reformer</i> in 1874, and not
republished as a book until 1880. Thomson
had a melancholy career which ended in drink
and disaster. He died in University Hospital,
London. His "City of Dreadful Night" is
peculiarly a reflection of the age that is passing.
It secured even during the poet's life the commendation
of George Eliot, of George Meredith, and
of other critics; and it may yet command a large
audience, who breathe the note of pessimism which
was always characteristic of the writer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The sense that every struggle brings defeat</p>
<p class="i1">Because Fate holds no prize to crown success,</p>
<p>That all the oracles are dumb or cheat</p>
<p class="i1">Because they have no secret to express;</p>
<p>That none can pierce the vast black veil uncertain</p>
<p>Because there is no light beyond the curtain;</p>
<p>That all is vanity and nothingness."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">A poet whom one names with peculiar reverence
is <b>Thomas Aubrey de Vere</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1814-</b></span>, the son of Sir Aubrey
de Vere, who was also a poet. Aubrey de Vere,
the younger, knew and loved Wordsworth, to whom
in 1842 he dedicated "The Waldenses: A Lyrical
Tale," and yet retains, sixty years later, the most
sympathetic interest in modern literary effort. Mr
de Vere is an Irishman, and was educated at
Trinity College, Dublin. He has written many
volumes of poetry and prose, his dramatic poems
"Alexander the Great" and "St Thomas of Canterbury"
having, no doubt, been largely inspired
by the successes of his friend and relative, Sir
Henry Taylor, and by his father's brilliant drama,
"Mary Tudor." One of his most recent books
was a volume of critical essays containing a notable
study of Wordsworth.</p>

<p class="p2">Irishmen have been fairly conspicuous in the
poetry of the epoch, and the term "Celtic
Renaissance" has begun to be used hopefully
by lovers of Ireland who desire that country
to have a literature as distinctly Irish as
Scotland has a literature definitely Scottish.
<b>Thomas Moore</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1779-1852</b></span> was the pioneer of this movement.
He had, it is true, done all his work before
the Queen came to the throne, although he
lived yet another fifteen years. His "Irish
Melodies" began to appear in 1807, "Lalla
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Rookh" was published in 1817, and the "Life
of Byron" in 1830. Moore was as much an
inspiration to modern Ireland as Burns to modern
Scotland, and the one country holds the name of
its poet as reverentially in memory as does the
other. Moore, however, lacked the note of
passionate sincerity which pertained to Burns;
although we may fairly ask what would have been
the career of Burns had he been thrown early into
the literary and social life of London&mdash;the London
of Byron's time.</p>

<p class="p2">The influence of Moore was strong in <b>Thomas
Davis</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1814-1845</b></span> whose "National and Historical Ballads,
Songs and Poems" caused so great a ferment in the
heart of Young Ireland. Many other Irish writers
deserve to be named, such as James Clarence
Mangan (1803-1849), Sir Samuel Ferguson (1810-1886),
Lady Dufferin (1807-1867) and John
Banim (1798-1842), who wrote, in conjunction
with his brother Michael, some twenty-four
volumes of Irish stories and verses. <b>Samuel
Lover</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1797-1868</b></span> is best known in England by his romance
"Rory O'More" and his ever popular "Handy
Andy," but in Ireland he is remembered as a writer
of lyrics and ballads of heart-stirring character.</p>

<p class="p2">An Irishman by descent, although not by birth,
was <b>Edward FitzGerald</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1883</b></span>, who was born in Suffolk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and lived all his life in the neighbourhood of Woodbridge
in that county. FitzGerald's "Letters and
Literary Remains" fill three substantial volumes,
but he lives for us by his translation or rather
paraphrase of the "Rubáyát of Omar Khayyám
of Naishápur," which first appeared in 1859. It
is generally agreed that FitzGerald, a nineteenth
century pagan, always reverently questioning the
mystery of existence, superadded his own personal
thoughts and feelings to the verses of the
old Persian singer. In doing this he touched
deeply a certain aspect of the second half of the
nineteenth century and founded a cult. FitzGerald's
verses, however, have been ardently
admired by many who are far from accepting
their pessimist view of life.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Hartley Coleridge</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1796-1849</b></span> wrote and published his
admirable sonnets before 1837. He was a
son of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834),
whose literary remains were edited by Henry
Nelson Coleridge, a nephew and son-in-law. H.
N. Coleridge married the great poet's only daughter,
<b>Sara Coleridge</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1852</b></span>, who wrote one poem, "Phantasmion,"
and whose letters throw much light on an
important chapter of literary history.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Bryan Waller Procter</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1787-1874</b></span>, better known as "Barry
Cornwall," was at school with Lord Byron at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Harrow. His "Dramatic Scenes," "Marcian
Colonna," and "Mirandola" were much talked of
in their day. Procter was admired as a poet by
Byron, Moore, and other famous contemporaries,
but no one reads him now. A happier fate has
befallen his daughter, <b>Adelaide Anne Procter</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1825-1864</b></span>,
whose "Legends and Lyrics" are still widely
popular.</p>

<p class="p2">Winthrop Mackworth Praed, who wrote much
admirable humorous and satirical verse, is not a
Victorian author, although his present popularity
makes that rather hard to realise. He died in
1839. <b>Richard Hengist Horne</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1884</b></span>, on the other
hand, although he lived into our time, is now
remembered only by his friendship with Mrs Browning
and by the humorous freak of publishing his
epic "Orion" at a farthing. He was the author
of a miracle play entitled "Judas Iscariot," a
tragedy entitled "The Death of Marlowe," and
many other works.</p>

<p class="p2">Another writer of well-nigh forgotten tragedies
was <b>Thomas Lovell Beddoes</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1849</b></span>, who wrote "The
Bride's Tragedy" and "Death's Jest Book." A
like extinction, it is to be feared, has befallen
Ebenezer Jones and Ebenezer Elliott&mdash;the former
of whom belonged to that spasmodic school of
poets of which Alexander Smith and Philip James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Bailey were supposed to be the leaders. <b>Ebenezer
Jones </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-1860</b></span> wrote "Studies in Sensation and Event," to
which in 1879 his brother, Sumner Jones, attached
an interesting biography. There is very genuine
poetry in the volume, but it is not likely to be
republished. <b>Ebenezer Elliott </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1781-1849</b></span> had a very different
fate. He enjoyed for many years the suffrages of
the multitude. His "Corn Law Rhymes" played
a considerable part in the political agitation of the
period. James Montgomery called him "the poet
of the poor." Another writer with a fine democratic
impulse was <b>Gerald Massey</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828- </b></span>, who was associated
with the Chartist movement, and wrote
"Poems and Charms" and "Voices of Freedom
and Lyrics of Love." Another Chartist was
<b>Thomas Cooper </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1805-1892</b></span>, who wrote "The Purgatory of
Suicides" and many other poems and an entertaining
autobiography. Cooper was an active
political agitator, and was imprisoned for two
years in Stafford gaol for sedition.</p>

<p class="p2">A poet who holds a great place in the minds of
many is <b>William Barnes </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-1886</b></span>, who kept a school for a
time in Mr Thomas Hardy's town of Dorchester.
He afterwards became a clergyman and rector of
Winterbourne-Came. He was a philologist as
well as a poet, and published many works on
language. His interest for us here is in his
"Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
(1844). Another poet-clergyman of great learning
was <b>Robert Stephen Hawker</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1875</b></span> whose work
reflects Devonshire and Cornwall as Barnes' reflects
Dorsetshire. He wrote the "Song of the
Western Men" which he deceived Macaulay into
believing to be an old Cornish ballad, and the
great historian introduced it into his "History
of England" as an example of the excitement
caused by the arrest of the seven bishops.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Its
stirring refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And shall Trelawney die, and shall Trelawney die?</p>
<p>Then thirty thousand Cornish boys will know the reason why"</p>
</div>

<p>will always keep Hawker in remembrance. He
was vicar of Morwenstow and wrote several
volumes of poems and some prose, including
"Footprints of Former Men in Far Cornwall."</p>

<p class="p2">Two poets, father and son, made the name of
Marston honoured in their days. John Westland
Marston (1819-1890) was born at Boston, Lincolnshire.
He wrote two dramas, "Strathmore"
and "Marie de Méranie," which had much success
some years ago. Another work, "A Hard
Struggle," obtained the enthusiastic praise of
Dickens. Dr Garnett claims for Marston that he
was long the chief upholder of the poetical drama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
on the English stage. <b>Philip Bourke Marston</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1850-1887</b></span>, a
son of Westland Marston, should not have failed
of literary success, as he had for godfather Philip
James Bailey, the author of "Festus," and for
godmother Miss Mulock, author of "John Halifax,
Gentleman." He, however, became blind at
three years of age. He published three volumes
of verse, "Song Tide and Other Poems" (1871),
"All in All" (1875) and "Wind Voices" (1883).
They were never popular, although his poetry
gained him the esteem of many eminent men,
Rossetti and Mr Swinburne among others. Mrs
Chandler Moulton, an American lady who wrote
"Swallow Flights," gave us a memoir of Philip
Bourke Marston. In this she was assisted by Mr
William Sharp, who was also one of Rossetti's biographers.
Mrs Moulton did a like good office to
the memory of <b>Arthur O'Shaughnessy</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1844-1881</b></span>, a poet of
considerable distinction in his day. O'Shaughnessy
married the younger Marston's sister. His
"Epic of Women &amp; Other Poems," published in
1870, was a volume of very great promise. He
wrote other verses, which never attained to quite
the same measure of success.</p>

<p class="p2">It only remains for me to name <b>Alfred Austin</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1835-</b></span>
the Poet Laureate. After Lord Tennyson's death
in 1892 the office remained vacant for four years.
The two poets who might have been considered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
have had some claim, William Morris and Mr
Swinburne, were supposed to be impossible on
account of democratic sympathies, although it is
doubtful if either would have accepted the office.
Almost every living poet, however small the bulk
of his achievement, and however inconsiderable
his years, was nominated&mdash;by the press&mdash;in turn.
Finally, in 1896, by a pleasant irony of circumstances,
the laureateship was given to a journalist,&mdash;for
Mr Austin had been a leader-writer on the staff
of the <i>Standard</i> newspaper for many years. He
has written "The Golden Age, a Satire" (1871),
"Savonarola" (1881), "English Lyrics" (1891),
and many prose works. His "English Lyrics"
contained an appreciative introduction by William
Watson, the author of "Wordsworth's Grave,"
"Lachrymæ Musarum," and other poems which
have been received with abundant cordiality by
the press and public. Another living poet who has
been well and justly praised is <b>Rudyard Kipling</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1864-</b></span>.
He made his earliest fame as a writer of short
stories of Indian military life. "Soldiers Three"
and "Wee Willie Winkie" have entirely captivated
the imagination of Mr Kipling's contemporaries.
It is as a poet, however, that he will perhaps
longest retain his hold upon them. His "Barrack-Room
Ballads" (1892) are finely touched with that
martial spirit which so strongly appeals to the heart
of our nation.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center b15">The Novelists</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Any comparison of the novels of the Victorian
Era, with the novels of the Georgian Period,
must be very much to the disadvantage of the
former. The great epoch of English fiction began
with Goldsmith and Richardson, and ended with
Sir Walter Scott. It was an epoch which gave
us "The Vicar of Wakefield," "Clarissa," "Tom
Jones," "Pride and Prejudice," "Humphrey
Clinker," and "Tristram Shandy." That fiction had
a naturalness and spontaneity to which the novels
of the Victorian Era can lay no claim. The
novels of the period with which we are concerned
aspire to regenerate mankind. Dickens, indeed,
started off with but little literary equipment save
sundry eighteenth century novels. He had read
Smollett, and Fielding, and Sterne, diligently.
But the influence of these humourists&mdash;so marked
in "Pickwick"&mdash;became qualified in his succeeding
books by the strenuous spirit of the times.</p>

<p class="p2">It is alike interesting in itself and convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
for my purpose that the most popular novelist of
the Victorian era should have published his first
great book in 1837. Dickens awoke then to
abundant fame, and his popularity has never
waned for an instant during the sixty succeeding
years. To-day he may be more or less decried
by "literary" people, but his audience has multiplied
twofold. He has added to it the countless
thousands whom the School Board has given to
the reading world.</p>

<p><b>Charles Dickens</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1812-1870</b></span> was born at Landport, Portsea,
his father being an improvident clerk in the Navy
Pay Office at Portsmouth. Dickens senior has
been immortalized for us by the not too pleasing
portrait of "Micawber." After infinite struggle
and penury, Dickens became a reporter for the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>. Under the signature of
"Boz" he wrote "Sketches" for the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i> in 1834. "Pickwick" appeared from
April 1836 to November 1837, and alike in parts
and in book form took the world by storm.
It was succeeded by "Oliver Twist" (1838),
"Nicholas Nickleby" (1839), "The Old Curiosity
Shop" (1840), and "Barnaby Rudge" (1841).
From this time forth Dickens was the most popular
writer that our literature has seen. Within twelve
years after his death some four millions of his
books were sold in England, and there is no
reason to believe that this popularity has in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
way abated, although George Eliot foretold that
much of Dickens's humour would be meaningless
to the next generation, that is to say, to the
generation which is now with us. It is the fashion
to call Dickens the novelist of the half-educated,
to charge him with lack of reflectiveness, with incapacity
for serious reasoning. His humour has
been described as insincere, his pathos as exaggerated.
Much of this indictment may with equal
justice be made against Richardson and even against
Jane Austen, who surely anticipated Dickens by the
creation of the Rev. William Collins.</p>

<p>If Dickens had been a learned University Professor
he would not have possessed the equipment
most needful for the artist who was to portray to
us in an imperishable manner the London which
is now fast disappearing. The people who
censure Dickens are those for whom he has served
a purpose and is of no further use. They are a
mere drop in the ocean of readers. It is not
easy to-day to gauge his precise position.
The exhaustion of many of his copyrights has
given up his work to a host of rival publishers.
There are probably thousands of men and women
now, as there were in the fifties and sixties, who
have been stimulated by him, and who have found in
his writings the aid to a cheery optimism which has
made life more tolerable amid adverse conditions.
Mrs Richmond Ritchie, Thackeray's daughter, tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
us how keenly Dickens's capacity for stirring the
heart was felt even in the home of the rival novelist.
Thackeray's youngest daughter, then a child,
looked up from the book she was reading to ask
the question, "Papa, why do you not write books
like 'Nicholas Nickleby'"? Thackeray himself
shared the general enthusiasm. "David Copperfield!"
he writes to a correspondent, "By Jingo!
It is beautiful! It is charming! Bravo Dickens!
It has some of his very brightest touches&mdash;those
inimitable Dickens touches which make such a
great man of him. And the reading of the book
has done another author a great deal of good....
It has put me on my mettle and made me feel that
I must do something; that I have fame and name
and family to support."</p>

<p class="p2">If Dickens is still beloved by the multitude,
the name of <b>William Makepeace Thackeray</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1811-1863</b></span> has
entirely eclipsed his in the minds of a certain
literary section of the community. Thackeray
stands to them for culture, Dickens for illiteracy.
Thackeray had indeed a more polished intellect;
he had also a more restrained style. Thackeray
was born at Calcutta. His father, who was an
Indian civil servant, died when the boy was only
five years old. He was educated at Charterhouse
School and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1831
he went to Weimar. He studied long at Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
with a view to becoming an artist, and when
"Pickwick" wanted an illustrator to continue the
work of Seymour who had committed suicide,
Thackeray applied to Dickens, but Hablot Browne
was chosen, and Thackeray was disappointed&mdash;happily
for the world, which lost an indifferent
artist to gain a great author. Thackeray in 1837&mdash;the
year which saw the publication of "Pickwick"
as a volume&mdash;joined the staff of <i>Fraser's
Magazine</i>. In that journal appeared in succession
"The History of Samuel Titmarsh and the
Great Hoggarty Diamond," "The Yellowplush
Papers," and "The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon."
In 1847 "Vanity Fair" was begun in numbers,
and not till then did its author secure real renown.
"Pendennis" was published in 1850, and "Esmond"
in 1852. "The Newcomes" (1854) is in
some measure a sequel to "Pendennis," as "The
Virginians" (1858) is in some measure a sequel
to "Esmond." These are the five works by
Thackeray which everyone must read. In 1857
Thackeray unsuccessfully contested Oxford. In
1859 he undertook the editorship of the new
<i>Cornhill Magazine</i> which flourished in his hands.
These were the halcyon days of magazine editors.
On Macaulay's death in 1859, Thackeray talked
of purchasing the historian's vacant house. A
friend remarked upon his prosperity. "To make
money one must edit a magazine," was the answer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
He did not buy Macaulay's house, but built
himself one at Palace Green, and here he died
the day before Christmas-day 1863. His daughter,
Anne Thackeray, who became Mrs Richmond
Ritchie, has written "Old Kensington" and other
stories of singular charm.</p>

<p>The twenty-six volumes of Thackeray's works
make a veritable nursery of style for the modern
literary aspirant. But it is, as has been said, upon
his five great novels that his future fame must rest.
They are as permanent a picture of life among the
well-to-do classes as those Dickens has given us
of life among the poor.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Charlotte Brontë</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1816-1855</b></span>, who gave to Thackeray the
enthusiastic hero-worship of her early years, called
him a Titan, and dedicated "Jane Eyre" to him,
had little enough in common with the author of
"Vanity Fair." The daughter of a poor parson
of Irish birth, she was born at Thornton in Yorkshire.
She and two sisters grew up in the cramped
atmosphere of a vicarage at Haworth, in the centre
of the moorlands. They wrote stories and poems
from childhood, and dreamed of literary fame.
Meanwhile it was necessary to add to the scanty
stipend of their father; two of them went back
as governesses to the school in which they had
been educated; and all of them a little later attempted
the uncongenial life of private governesses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
The desire to have a school of their own led
Charlotte and her sister Emily to Brussels, where
they studied French and German. Returning to
the Haworth parsonage, the three sisters, Charlotte,
Emily, and Anne, with money left them by
an aunt, published a volume of verse&mdash;"Poems
by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell." Then each
sister produced from her drawer the manuscript
of a novel, and Charlotte's "Professor," Emily's
"Wuthering Heights," and Anne's "Agnes Grey"
were sent round to the publishers and returned
more than once to the parsonage. Finally the
"Professor" was read by Smith &amp; Elder, who
asked for a longer story by the writer. "Jane
Eyre" (1847) was the result, and that story became
one of the most successful novels of the day.
It was followed by "Shirley" (1849) and "Villette"
(1853). In 1854 Charlotte Brontë became Mrs
Arthur Bell Nicholls, and the wife of her father's
curate. In the following year she died. "The
Professor" was published two years after her death.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Emily Brontë</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1818-1848</b></span> accomplished less than her elder
sister, but her name will live as long. She secured
the admiration of Sydney Dobell, of Matthew
Arnold, and of Mr Swinburne, and her best verse
is perhaps the greatest ever written by a woman.
"Last Lines" and "The Old Stoic" will rank
with the finest poetry in our literature. Her one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
novel, "Wuthering Heights," has been most happily
criticised by Mr Swinburne: "As was the author's
life so is her book in all things; troubled and taintless,
with little of rest in it and nothing of reproach.
It may be true that not many will ever take it to
their hearts; it is certain that those who do like it
will like nothing very much better in the whole
world of poetry or prose."</p>

<p>Emily Brontë's sole contributions to literature
were the poems written in conjunction with her two
sisters under the name of Ellis Bell, some further
poems published by her sister Charlotte after her
death, and the single novel "Wuthering Heights."</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Anne Brontë</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-1849</b></span> wrote more than her sister Emily,
but with less of recognition. She contributed
verses to the little volume of poems under the
name of Acton Bell, and additional verses were
published after her death by Charlotte. In
addition to this she wrote two novels, the first
of them "Agnes Grey," and the second "The
Tenant of Wildfell Hall." This last, curiously
enough, went into a second edition during Anne's
lifetime, and she contributed a preface to it defending
herself against her critics. Neither Anne's
poetry nor her novels are of any account to-day.
They would not be read, were it not for the glory
with which her two sisters have surrounded the
name of Brontë.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>Women novelists have abundantly flourished
during the Victorian Era, but then the path
was made easy for them by Jane Austen,
Maria Edgeworth, and Fanny Burney. By all
those who delight in debatable comparisons the
name of George Eliot is frequently brought into
contrast with that of Charlotte Brontë. <b>George
Eliot</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-1880</b></span> was born at Griff in Warwickshire, her real
name being Mary Ann Evans. She was for a
time at a school at Nuneaton, and afterwards at
Coventry. At first she was an evangelical churchwoman,
but about 1842 she became acquainted
with two or three cultivated women friends at
whose houses she met Froude, Emerson, and
Francis Newman, all of whom represented a
reverent antagonism to supernatural Christianity.
In conjunction with Sarah Hennell, she undertook
a translation of Strauss's "Life of Jesus." On her
father's death, in 1849, she came to London and
became associated with Dr Chapman in the editorship
of the <i>Westminster Review</i>. It was her
friendship with George Henry Lewes, whom she met
in 1851, which gave her the first impulse towards
fiction. Lewes was an active critic, and a writer of
two now forgotten novels. Miss Evans's "Scenes
of Clerical Life" were sent to Blackwood's Magazine
in 1856. The stories were a great success.
Thackeray and Dickens were loud in expressions
of admiration. In 1859 "Adam Bede" was published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and made George Eliot famous. "It is the
finest thing since Shakspere," said Charles Reade.
Her success, however, did not lead to hasty production.
She wrote only six novels during the
remainder of her life. "I can write no word that
is not prompted from within," she said. "The
Mill on the Floss" was written in 1860; "Silas
Marner" in 1861; "Romola" in 1863; "Felix
Holt" in 1866; "Middlemarch" in 1871-1872;
and "Daniel Deronda" in 1876.</p>

<p>In 1880 Miss Mary Ann Evans became Mrs
Walter Cross, but after a few months of wedded
life she died of inflammation of the heart at 4
Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. Her husband wrote her
biography, not with much success. So entirely
was George Eliot's best mind concentrated
upon her books that her letters, and indeed
her personality, were a disappointment to all but
a few hero-worshippers.</p>

<p class="p2">The novels, with two volumes of poems and two
of essays, make up George Eliot's collected works.
The essays written before and after her novels give,
like her letters, but few indications of her remarkable
powers. Nor, although "The Spanish Gipsy"
is deeply interesting, can her poetry be counted
for much. "The Choir Invisible" is her best
known poem. It is by her novels that she must
be judged, and these, for insight into character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
analysis of the motives which guide men, and
sympathy with the intellectual and moral struggles
which make up so large a part of life, have a
literary niche to themselves. With singular catholicity
she paints the simplest faith and the highest
idealism. Whether it be an Evangelical clergyman,
a Dissenting minister, or a Methodist factory-girl,
she enters into the spirit of their lives with fullest
sympathy. Carlyle could see in Methodism only
"a religion fit for gross and vulgar-minded people,
a religion so-called, and the essence of it <i>cowardice</i>
and <i>hunger</i>, terror of pain and appetite for pleasure
both carried to the infinite." George Eliot's sympathies
were wider. She won the heart of Methodists,
who have stood in imagination listening to
Dinah Morris addressing the Hayslope peasantry,
as she gained the devotion of Roman Catholics
like Lord Acton, who have seen in her portrait
of Savonarola a wise expression of their faith.
And it is not only in religious matters that
her sympathies are so broad. The sententious
dulness of Mr Macey is as much within the range
of her feelings as the manliness of Adam Bede or
the scholastic pride of old Bardo. She feels
equally for the weak and frivolous Hetty and the
lofty, self-sustained Romola. "At least eighty
out of a hundred," she says, "of your adult male
fellow-Britons returned in the last census are
neither extraordinarily silly nor extraordinarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
wicked, nor extraordinarily wise; their eyes are
neither deep and liquid with sentiment, nor sparkling
with suppressed witticisms; they have probably
had no hairbreadth escapes or thrilling
adventures; their brains are certainly not pregnant
with genius, and their passions have not manifested
themselves at all after the fashion of a volcano.
They are simply men of complexions more or less
muddy, whose conversation is more or less bald
and disjointed. Yet these commonplace people&mdash;many
of them&mdash;bear a conscience, and have felt
the sublime promptings to do the painful right;
they have their unspoken sorrows and their sacred
joys; their hearts have perhaps gone out towards
their first-born, and they have mourned over the
irreclaimable dead. Nay, is there not a pathos in
their very insignificance, in our comparison of their
dim and narrow existence with the glorious possibilities
of that human nature which they share?
Depend upon it you would gain unspeakably if
you would learn with me to see some of the poetry
and the pathos, the tragedy and the comedy, lying
in the experience of a human soul that looks out
through dull gray eyes, and that speaks in a voice
of quite ordinary tones." The creations of George
Eliot,&mdash;Tito and Baldassare, Mrs Poyser and
Silas Marner, Dorothy Brooke and Gwendolen,&mdash;are
not as familiar to the reading public of to-day
as they were to that of ten or fifteen years ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Of the idolatry which almost made her a prophetess
of a new cult we hear nothing now.
She has not maintained her position as Dickens,
Thackeray, and Charlotte Brontë have maintained
theirs. But if there be little of partisanship and
much detraction, it is idle to deny that George
Eliot's many gifts, her humour, her pathos, her
remarkable intellectual endowments, give her an
assured place among the writers of Victorian
literature.</p>

<p class="p2">The next in order of prominence among the
novelists of the period is <b>Charles Kingsley</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-1875</b></span>. He
was born at Holne Vicarage, on the borders of
Dartmoor, and was educated at King's College,
London, and Magdalen College, Cambridge.
After this he received the curacy of Eversley,
in Hampshire, of which parish he finally became
rector. In 1848 he published a drama entitled
"The Saint's Tragedy," with St Elizabeth of
Hungary as heroine. A year later his novel of
"Alton Locke" gained him the title of "The
Chartist Parson." This tale, in which Carlyle is
introduced in the person of an old Scotch bookseller,
was a crude and yet vigorous expression of
sympathy with the Chartist movement, and its influence
was tremendous. For its sympathy with
the working classes, and in its reflection of the
broad and tolerant Christianity of which Kingsley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
was always the eloquent preacher, "Alton Locke,"
in common with "Yeast" and "Two Years Ago,"
is a valuable contribution to literature. Kingsley,
however, became a truer artist when, as in
"Hypatia" and "Westward Ho!" he had not
social and religious ends in view. "Hypatia,"
in spite of many historical errors, is a brilliant
sketch of the early Church at Alexandria. Gibbon,
from whom Kingsley obtained the hint for this
book, would have revelled in the apparent endorsement
by a latter-day clergyman of his estimate
of the early Christianity of the East. "Westward
Ho!" is a picturesque narrative of English rivalry
with Spain in the reign of Elizabeth. The contrasts
of character in Frank and Amyas Leigh
perhaps give this novel a claim to be considered
Kingsley's best effort. He wrote many other
works, including children's stories, scientific lectures,
and poems, among which last the beautiful
ballads, "The Three Fishers" and "The Sands
of Dee," are the most popular. For nine years he
held the office of Professor of Modern History
at Cambridge University, but his unphilosophical
views of history made his presence there a misfortune.
A model country clergyman, a man
essentially healthy-minded and interested in all
phases of life and thought, Kingsley's influence,
especially on young men, during the past five-and-thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
years, has been very great and very
beneficial.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Henry Kingsley</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1830-1876</b></span>, a younger brother of Charles,
wrote many novels and romances, three of them
memorable. "Geoffrey Hamlyn" is popular as
the best novel of Australian life. To Australia
he had gone to make his fortune at the diggings.
He did not make a fortune, but joined the colonial
mounted police instead. Compelled by his office
to attend an execution, he threw up the post in
disgust, and returned to England to find his
brother installed as Vicar of Eversley and on
the high road to fame. Little wonder that he
attempted to emulate him, and he succeeded.</p>

<p>Never, surely, has literature produced two brothers
so remarkable, and at the same time so different.
Both gave us energetic heroes, and loved
manliness. In Charles Kingsley, however,
the novelist was always largely subordinated to
the preacher. In Henry there was nothing of
the preacher whatever. "Geoffrey Hamlyn,"
"Ravenshoe" and "The Hillyars and The
Burtons," are all forcible, effective works, and they
have secured generous praise and appreciation
from many a literary colleague. But Henry was a
bit of a ne'er-do-well, and so his personality has
been carefully screened from the public. His
name is not even mentioned in Charles Kingsley's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
biography. Sir Edwin Arnold, however, who knew
him at Oxford, and Mrs Thackeray Ritchie, who
knew him towards the end of his life, testify to
certain delightful qualities of mind and heart
which peculiarly appealed to them.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="p2">A writer not less successful than Charles
Kingsley, but in no way comparable as a man,
was <b>Edward Bulwer Lytton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1873</b></span>, Baron Lytton, who
was born in London, and created no small sensation
in 1828 by the publication of "Pelham."
This was followed by a long list of novels of
infinite variety. Some dealt with the preternatural
like "Zanoni," and others with history, psychology,
and ethics. Of these the most popular were doubtless
the historical "Harold," "Rienzi," "The Last
of the Barons," and "The Last Days of Pompeii,"
which still hold their own with the younger generation.
The thoughtful men of to-day do not however
read "The Caxtons" as they did in the sixties
and seventies. Lytton was one of the cleverest
men of his age&mdash;using the word in no friendly
sense&mdash;he was a clever novelist, a clever dramatist
(his comedy of "Money," and his tragedies
"Richelieu" and "The Lady of Lyons," still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
hold the stage), and a clever Parliamentary
debater.</p>

<p class="p2">Another writer, with higher claims to consideration
than those of literature, was <b>Benjamin Disraeli</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1804-1881</b></span>,
Earl of Beaconsfield. Disraeli entered life under
conditions peculiarly favourable to a successful
literary career. His father, Isaac D'Israeli, was
an enthusiastic bookworm, whose "Curiosities of
Literature" and other books are an inexhaustible
mine of anecdote on the quarrels and calamities
of authors. The young Disraeli wrote "Vivian
Grey" in 1827, following this very successful effort
with "The Young Duke," "Venetia," "Henrietta
Temple," and other novels. In 1837 he
was returned to Parliament as member for Maidstone.
His career as an orator and statesman
does not concern us here; suffice to say that of
his many later novels "Coningsby," "Tancred,"
and "Sybil" are by far the ablest and most
brilliant, and that "Sybil" was an effective
exposure of many abuses in the relations of
capital to labour. In addition to his work as a
novelist, Lord Beaconsfield wrote an able biography
of his friend and colleague, Lord George
Bentinck.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most successful of the greater novelists
of the reign was <b>Charles Reade</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1814-1884</b></span>, who first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
became famous by "Peg Woffington" in 1852.
"The Cloister and the Hearth" was published in
1861, and "Griffith Gaunt" in 1866. Several of
his later novels were written "with a purpose." In
"Hard Cash" he drew attention to the abuses of
private lunatic asylums; in "Foul Play" he
aroused public interest in the iniquities of ship-knackers;
in "Put Yourself in His Place," he
attacked Trades Unions, and in "Never Too Late
to Mend" he exposed some of the abuses of our
prison system as it existed at that time. Reade
was also an industrious dramatist; "Masks and
Faces," and "Drink," are among his most popular
plays. Of all his books "The Cloister and the
Hearth" is the best, and also the most widely
read. It has for its hero the father of Erasmus.</p>

<p class="p2">Those who in days to come will want to know
what provincial life was really like in England
in early Victorian times will enquire for the
novels of <b>Anthony Trollope</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1815-1822</b></span>. "Barchester
Towers," "Framley Parsonage," and "Dr
Thorne," are the most popular of a series of
tales, in all of which the country life of England,
its clergy and squirearchy, are portrayed.
Trollope wrote on many subjects. His "Life of
Cicero" secured the commendation of Professor
Freeman, and his biography of Thackeray,
though all too slight, is the best book about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the author of "Vanity Fair" that has so far
been given us.</p>

<p class="p2">Another novelist of about equal status with
Trollope in mid-Victorian fiction is <b>George John
Whyte Melville</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1821-1878</b></span>. Major Whyte Melville is the
novelist of all lovers of the hunting-field, and
strangely enough he fell a victim to the very
sport which he had done so much to picture.
He was killed by a fall from his horse. Whyte
Melville's hunting novels include "Katerfelto"
and "Black but Comely." He also wrote historical
novels, of which "The Queen's Maries" and "The
Gladiators" were the most popular, and he had a
pretty gift of verse.</p>

<p class="p2">Literature has rarely produced a more picturesque
figure than <b>Robert Louis Stevenson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1850-1894</b></span>.
The son of a famous Scottish engineer he was
destined, like his great countryman Sir Walter
Scott, for a Writership to the Signet. He took,
however, to literature instead, and died at forty-four
in Samoa,&mdash;where he had gone for his health,&mdash;after
a remarkable literary achievement. With
a style not always rigidly grammatical, but always
impressive and distinguished, he shone in
many branches of literary work. He wrote
travel pictures like "With a Donkey in the
Cevennes," which were incomparably superior to
those of any contemporary; his plays&mdash;written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in collaboration with Mr W. E. Henley&mdash;had a
power of their own, and one of them, "Beau
Austin," although not accepted by the public,
is probably the greatest contribution to the drama
of the era. As a critic of life and of books
Stevenson has also an honourable place. I know
of no better treatment of the one than "Virginibus
Puerisque," or of the other than "Some Aspects
of Robert Burns." He has given abundant
pleasure to children by "A Child's Garden of
Verses," and in "Underwoods" he has scarcely
less successfully appealed to their elders.</p>

<p>It is as a novelist, however, that Stevenson fills
the largest place. He is the inheritor of the
traditions of Scott, with the world-pain of his own
epoch superadded. Men and boys alike have
found "Treasure Island" absorbing, while men
have also pondered over the widely different
powers which are displayed in "The New Arabian
Nights" and "The Master of Ballantrae," "Prince
Otto," and "St Ives." "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"
is a parable which has thrilled us all.</p>

<p class="p2">Stevenson delighted to call Mr George Meredith
his master, and the two men were friends of
years. <b>George Meredith</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828-</b></span> began his literary career
in 1851, with a volume of poems, one of which,
"Love in a Valley," is still an unqualified joy to
all who read it. Mr Meredith has published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
several volumes of poems since then, and all of
them have their loyal admirers, but it is as a
novelist that the world at large appraises him.</p>

<p>His concentrated thought and vivid passion
have gained for him the title of the "Browning
of novelists." Each of his books in turn has
had its ardent partisans among cultivated and
thoughtful readers. "The Shaving of Shagpat"
appeared in 1856, and "Farina" in 1857.
"The Ordeal of Richard Feverel," which appeared
in 1859, is by many considered Meredith's
best novel. It treats, with subtle humour and
profound philosophical insight, of the problem
of a youth's education, and is full of truth to life.
"Feverel" was followed by "Evan Harrington"
(1861), while "Rhoda Fleming" (1865), "The
Adventures of Harry Richmond" (1871), "Beauchamp's
Career" (1876), "The Egoist" (1879),
"The Tragic Comedians" (1881), and "Diana
of the Crossways" (1885), have each of them
abundance of readers. Merely to enumerate
George Meredith's novels is to call to the
memory of all who have read them a widening
of mental and moral vision. The rich vein of
poetry running through the books, their humour
and imagination, place their author in the very
front rank of English novelists. "I should never
forgive myself," said Robert Louis Stevenson, "if
I forgot 'The Egoist,' which, of all the novels I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
have read (and I have read thousands), stands in
a place by itself. I have read 'The Egoist' five
or six times, and I mean to read it again." Others
have spoken with equal enthusiasm of "Sandra
Belloni," with its sweet singer Emilia; others
of "Beauchamp's Career," with its aristocratic
Radical, now generally understood to have been
intended for Admiral Maxse.</p>

<p>Mr Meredith dedicated his volume of "Poems"
of 1851 to <b>Thomas Love Peacock</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1785-1866</b></span>, who, perhaps,
more than any other writer influenced his
own style. Peacock was born at Weymouth,
and he was mainly self-educated. In 1804
and 1806 he published two small volumes of
poetry, "The Monks of St Mark" and "Palmyra."
In 1812 he became acquainted with
Shelley, and the two were intimate at Great
Marlow where Peacock lived in 1815, and later.
Peacock's novels "Headlong Hall" (1816-1817),
"Melincourt" (1817) and "Nightmare Abbey"
(1818), which have been two or three times reprinted
within the last five or six years, gained no
commensurate attention on their appearance,
although one of them was translated into
French. In 1819 Peacock became a clerk in
the India House, and married a Welsh girl,
Jane Gryffdh. "Maid Marion" appeared in
1822, "Crotchet Castle" in 1831, and in 1837
"Paper Money Lyrics and other Poems." All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the novels I have named, and they are his
most famous, belong to the pre-Victorian period,
but "Gryll Grange," his last novel, was published
in 1861. Peacock is interesting as a novelist and
for his relations with other famous men. He was,
as I have said, the friend of Shelley, and he was
the father-in-law of Mr George Meredith. Added
to this he succeeded to James Mill's post at the
India House, and vacated it for James Mill's son,
John Stuart Mill.</p>

<p>To R. L. Stevenson we undoubtedly owe much
of the impulse to the modern romantic movement,
which adds every day an historical novel or a story
of adventure to our libraries. It has given us Stanley
Weyman, "Q" (A. T. Quiller Couch), "Anthony
Hope," Max Pemberton, and Conan Doyle, the
creator of Sherlock Holmes. Another Scotsman,
<b>George MacDonald</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1824-</b></span>, whose "Robert Falconer,"
"David Elginbrod," and "Alec Forbes of Howglen,"
have charmed nearly a generation, had
less influence than might have been thought
upon the younger Scottish writers, who have made
Scottish scenes and Scottish dialect so marked an
element in many popular works. James Matthew
Barrie, for example, had written "A Window in
Thrums," before he had read one of Dr MacDonald's
books. Mr Barrie was probably influenced,
however, by John Galt (1779-1859),
whose "Ayrshire Legatees" and "Annals of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Parish" were written before the Queen began to
reign.</p>

<p>A writer whose most striking book was published
sufficiently long ago to justify its inclusion here, was
<b>Joseph Henry Shorthouse</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1834-</b></span>. His "John Inglesant"
gained for him a reputation which his "Sir Percival"
did not sustain. Mr Shorthouse has written
nothing since "John Inglesant" so beautiful as
his "Little Schoolmaster Mark," a singularly
poetical conception of abnormal childhood.</p>

<p>The best stories for children have been written
by <b>Lewis Carroll</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1833-</b></span>. This is the pseudonym of the
Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a lecturer on
mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford, and the
author of several mathematical text-books. In
"Euclid and his Modern Rivals" and "A Tangled
Tale," Mr Dodgson has succeeded in combining
his taste for science with a rich humour,
but his fame rests upon his remarkable fairy-stories,
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," published
in 1865, and its sequel, "Through the
Looking-Glass," which appeared in 1872. Men
and women, quite as much as little children, have
found pleasure and entertainment in these happy
efforts of a genius as individual as anything our age
has produced.</p>

<p class="p2">I have purposely all but ignored many writers
of fiction who are still actively engaged in literary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
pursuits. The daily journals bring their achievements
sufficiently to the front. But literary
workers owe so much to the untiring zeal of <b>Sir
Walter Besant</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-</b></span> in their behalf, that at the risk of
inconsistency I mention his "All Sorts and
Conditions of Men," a story which not only sold
by thousands, but had a practical influence such
as is rarely given to poet or novelist to achieve.
The writer dreams of a wealthy heiress devoting
her time and money to purifying and elevating the
East End of London. She builds a Palace of
Delight, and devotes it to the service of the people.
In May, 1887, the dream was realised, for the
Queen opened just such a Palace for the People in
the Mile-End Road. How far this institution, the
outcome of a novelist's imagination and the
generous subscriptions of philanthropists, has
achieved the regeneration of the London poor,
history has yet to record. Sir Walter Besant
wrote at an earlier period twelve novels in conjunction
with <b>James Rice</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1843-1882</b></span>, a collaborator of singular
humour and imagination. Of the books written
conjointly, "Ready Money Mortiboy" and "The
Golden Butterfly" are the most popular.</p>

<p class="p2">Passing from the acknowledged masters in
imaginative literature, one turns to a crowd of
popular and interesting writers who have charmed
and delighted multitudes of readers. Foremost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
among these are Lever and Marryat. <b>Charles
Lever</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1806-1872</b></span> was for some time editor of the <i>Dublin
University Magazine</i>, but his Irish stories,
"Charles O'Malley" and "Harry Lorrequer"
are his chief title to fame. That the rollicking
humour of these books still commands attention
is proved by a recent luxurious re-issue of them.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Another Irishman, who won the affections of
Irishmen as Lever won their laughter, was <b>William
Carleton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1798-1869</b></span>, who was born at Prillisk, county Tyrone.
He was the youngest of fourteen children. His
equal knowledge of Irish and English gave him an
intimacy with the folk-lore and fairy tales, which
make up so large a part in the lives of the poorer
among his countrymen, and "Traits and Stories
of the Irish Peasantry" (1833) and "Tales of
Ireland" (1834), were the result. His romance,
"Fardorougha the Miser," appeared in 1839, and
he treated in 1847 of the horrors of the Irish
famine in his "Black Prophet." Carleton has
for many years ceased to be read in England,
but he shares in the revived interest in Irish
literature, which has taken the place of interest
in Irish politics. <b>Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1814-1873</b></span> also
made a great success with "Uncle Silas" (1864)
and "In a Glass Darkly" (1872).</p>

<p><b>Frederick Marryat</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1792-1848</b></span> ran away to sea several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
times before his father, a member of Parliament of
great wealth, consented to his being a sailor. He
was a successful and popular naval officer before
he was twenty-one. He was thirty-seven years
of age when he wrote his first novel, "Frank
Mildmay," the success of which led him to adopt
literature as the profession of his later life. Of
his many novels, of which "Mr Midshipman Easy"
and "Peter Simple" are perhaps the best, several
appeared in the <i>Metropolitan Magazine</i>, which
Marryat edited for four years. Not only is
Marryat the most delightful of writers for boys,
but it is interesting to note that both Carlyle
and Ruskin during long terms of illness solaced
themselves with his wonderful sea-stories.</p>

<p class="p2">A writer who gave much healthy pleasure
to schoolboys was <b>William Henry Giles Kingston</b>
(<b>1814-1880</b>), who left behind him one hundred and
twenty-five stories of the sea. Another writer
for boys, <b>William Harrison Ainsworth</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1805-1882</b></span>, was the
son of a Manchester solicitor. The majority of
his thirty novels treat of historical themes. The
best of them, "Old St Paul's," "The Tower of
London," and "Rookwood," have been translated
into most modern languages. Scarcely less
popular for a time was <b>G. P. R. James</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1801-1860</b></span>, who also
dealt freely with history. Thackeray burlesqued
James so skilfully that he has already become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
a tradition. He was British Consul in Virginia,
and afterwards at Venice, where he died.</p>

<p class="p2">Living English novelists of well-deserved popularity,
are Mr Hardy, Mr Black, and Mr Blackmore.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Hardy</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1840-</b></span> made his earlier fame by "Far
from the Madding Crowd" (1874). He made his
later popularity by "Tess of the D'Urbervilles"
(1892). Between these books came two stories
greater than either&mdash;"The Return of the Native"
(1878) and "The Woodlanders" (1887). One
must read those books to appreciate how very
great a novelist Mr Hardy is, how full of poetry
and of insight. The Dorsetshire landscape which,
under the guise of "Wessex," he has made so
familiar, will be classic ground for many a day to
all lovers of good literature.</p>

<p class="p2">Although <b>William Black</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1841-</b></span>, who was born in Glasgow,
has written numerous stories about the West
Highlands of Scotland, he has no affinity whatever
to the new Scotch school. He made his first
appearance as a novelist in 1867 with "Love or
Marriage," and almost every year since he has
published a story, over thirty novels now bearing
his name. Black has recognised the value of the
picturesque back-ground afforded by West Highland
scenery, with its accompanying incidents in
the outdoor life of the deer stalker and angler.
He has given us some real characterization in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
"A Daughter of Heth" (1871), in "Madcap
Violet" (1876): while "Macleod of Dare" (1878)
is perhaps the best thing he has written.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Richard Doddridge Blackmore</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1825-</b></span> has written many
interesting novels, but it has been his perverse fate
to live by only one of them. "Lorna Doone" was
published in 1869, and although received coldly at
first, finally achieved great popularity: and visits
to the Lorna Doone country, as that part of Devonshire
is called, make part of the travelled education
of every literary American. As a master of
rustic comedy he stands unexcelled in our day, and
the merits of certain other novels&mdash;"The Maid of
Sker," "Christowell" and "Cripps the Carrier"&mdash;may
some day become more fully recognised.</p>

<p class="p2">Not less popular than the novelist of locality&mdash;for
this description may surely be applied to Mr
Hardy and the two other writers I have named&mdash;is
the novelist of sensation. <b>William Wilkie Collins</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1824-1889</b></span>
was the most prominent exponent of that School.
"The Woman in White," which appeared in 1860
in <i>All the Year Round</i>, took the town by storm,
but Count Fosco would be pronounced a tiresome
villain to-day. With "The Moonstone" and "The
New Magdalen" Wilkie Collins secured almost
equal success. Although it has been affirmed that a
new Wilkie Collins, that is to say a novelist of pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
sensation, might even now have a great vogue, it is
quite certain that the actual Wilkie Collins has lost
the greater part of his.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Another novelist who
presents himself as little more than a name to the
present generation is <b>Samuel Warren</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1807-1877</b></span>. He was a
doctor, and, like his homotype, Mr Conan Doyle
half a century later, studied medicine at the University
of Edinburgh. His "Passages from the
Diary of a Late Physician" began in <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> in 1830, and was well received,
but a still greater success attended his "Ten
Thousand a Year," which appeared first in the
same periodical.</p>

<p class="p2">Time has dealt unkindly with Samuel Warren:
it is yet to be seen how time will deal with another
popular favourite, <b>Mrs Henry Wood</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-1887</b></span>, who was born
in Worcestershire and made the city of Worcester
the centre of many of her stories. The "Channings"
and "Mrs Halliburton's Troubles" are her
best novels and they have had a well-deserved
popularity, for Mrs Wood had a splendid faculty
for telling a story. Her even more popular novel,
"East Lynne," will probably survive for many a
year as a stage play.</p>

<p class="p2">Next to Charlotte Brontë and George Eliot the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
most distinguished woman novelist of the era is
<b>Mrs Gaskell</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1810-1865</b></span>, who, as Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson,
married William Gaskell, a Unitarian minister of
Manchester. Mrs Gaskell's first literary success
was "Mary Barton," the story of a Manchester
factory girl. "Ruth," "North and South," and
"Sylvia's Lovers" were equally successful, but the
two books which are certain to secure immortality
to their author are "Cranford" (1853), and "The
Life of Charlotte Brontë" (1857). "Cranford"
is an idyll of village life which is sure to charm
many generations of readers, and not a few artists
have delighted to illustrate its quaint and fascinating
character studies. "Cranford" has been identified
with Knutsford in Cheshire. Mrs Gaskell's
biography of her friend Charlotte Brontë has
probably had a larger sale than any other biography
in our literature. Many causes contributed
to this&mdash;the popularity of the Brontë novels, the
exceptionally romantic and pathetic life of their
authors, Mrs Gaskell's own fame as a writer of
fiction, and the literary skill with which she treated
the material at her command.</p>

<p class="p2">Other women writers who have had a large
measure of fame, and are now well-nigh forgotten,
are Mrs Marsh (1791-1874), who wrote "The
Admiral's Daughter" and "The Deformed," Mrs
Crowe (1800-1876), who wrote "Susan Hopley"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and "The Night Side of Nature," Mrs Archer
Clive (1801-1873), who wrote "Paul Ferroll,"
Lady Georgiana Fullerton (1812-1885), the author
of "Ann Sherwood," Mrs Stretton (1812-1878),
who wrote "The Valley of a Hundred Fires."</p>

<p class="p2">All these are now little more than names to us,
but not so <b>Anne Manning</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1800-1879</b></span>, whose "Maiden and
Married Life of Mary Powell" will long continue to
be read. It is an effective presentation of Milton
and his first wife. <b>Mrs Norton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1808-1877</b></span>, "the Byron of
poetesses," as Lockhart described her, wrote several
novels, "Stuart of Dunleath" and "Lost and
Saved" being perhaps the best known in their time,
but she lives now mainly in George Meredith's
"Diana of the Crossways." <b>Dinah Mulock</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1826-1887</b></span> (Mrs
Craik) may still be ranked among our most popular
novelists, although her best and most successful
book, "John Halifax, Gentleman," was published
in 1857. The memory of <b>Julia Kavanagh</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1824-1877</b></span>, although
her "Madeleine" was enthusiastically
greeted on its appearance, has all but faded
away. Miss Kavanagh's "Woman in France in
the 18th Century," "English Women of Letters,"
and "French Women of Letters," were handsomely
got-up books, and are still to be found in many
old-fashioned libraries.</p>

<p class="p2">Two of the most popular writers for children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
were A.L.O.E. and Mrs Ewing. A.L.O.E.
or A Lady of England, was the pseudonym of
<b>Charlotte Maria Tucker</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1821-1893</b></span>, who after many years of
successful literary labour, went out to India for
the Church Missionary Society, at the age of fifty-four.
Miss Tucker's most popular stories were
"Pride and his Pursuers," "Exiles in Babylon,"
"House Beautiful," and "Cyril Ashley." Scarcely
less popular was <b>Mrs Ewing</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1841-1885</b></span>, whose mother, Mrs
Gatty, edited <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i>. It was in
this magazine that Mrs Ewing's "Remembrances
of Mrs Overtheway" made their appearance.</p>

<p class="p2">Another writer of great popularity, <b>Mrs Charles</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828-1896</b></span>,
secured an immense success with "The Schönberg-Cotta
Family," "Kitty Trevelyan's Diary," and
other books of a semi-religious, semi-historical
tendency. It is a natural association, not derived
from similarity of name, to mention <b>Maria Louisa
Charlesworth</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-1880</b></span> at the same time, because Miss
Charlesworth's "Ministering Children" had an
enormous success with the religious public of
England,&mdash;the public which supports Missionary
Societies and Sunday Schools.</p>

<p class="p2">I might easily devote many pages to the living
women novelists who have impressed themselves
upon the era; but that scarcely comes within the
scope of this little book. There are, to name but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
a few, Mrs Lynn Linton, Mrs Humphry Ward,
Ouida, Miss Braddon, Miss Marie Corelli, Miss
Olive Schreiner, Miss Rhoda Broughton, Edna
Lyall, Lucas Malet, Miss Charlotte Yonge, Miss
Adeline Sergeant, Mrs Macquoid, Mrs Alexander,
Mrs W. K. Clifford&mdash;names which recall to
thousands of readers many familiar books and
some of the happiest hours they have ever spent.</p>

<p class="p2">With the name of <b>Mrs Oliphant</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828-1897</b></span>, who has
recently died, I may fitly close this survey of
Victorian fiction. Mrs Oliphant struck the note
of the era alike in her versatility and in her lack
of thoroughness. She was so versatile that she once
offered to write a whole number of <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, a publication to which she was for years
a valued contributor. And she would have done
it with fair effectiveness. That she wrote good
fiction is now generally acknowledged. She wrote
also biography, criticism, and every form of
prose. Her "Makers of Florence" has been a
popular history,&mdash;it treats of Dante, Giotto, and
Savonarola,&mdash;as her "Life of Edward Irving" has
been a popular biography. She wrote many other
books apart from her fiction, "A History of
Eighteenth Century Literature," a "Memoir of
Principal Tulloch," biographies of Cervantes and
Molière, and a volume on "Dress." But she was
not a good critic, nor was she a very accurate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
student. It is upon her novels that her fame will
have to rest. "Salem Chapel," a skilful delineation
of a minister and his congregation, has been
compared to George Eliot's "Silas Marner."
"Passages in the Life of Margaret Maitland"
(1849) was her first novel and "The Lady's Walk"
(1897) her last, and in the intervening years she
probably wrote sixty or seventy stories, each of
them containing indications of a genius which,
with more concentration, would have given her
an enduring place in English fiction.

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center b15">The Historians</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The reign of Victoria has been pre-eminently
the reign of the historian in our literature.
Greater poets we had seen in the reigns of the
Georges, greater essayists in the reign of Anne.
But Grote and Carlyle, Macaulay and Gardiner,
Bishop Stubbs and Dr Freeman, had no counterparts
in an earlier age&mdash;always excepting the
one great name of Gibbon. Before them there
were chroniclers of contemporary events and
pamphleteers under the guise of historians, but
little more. Goldsmith's histories are the
laughing-stock of those to whom the modern
methods of research are familiar, and even Hume
had little of the spirit of the genuine student.
Hallam and Lingard were the pioneers in this
branch of literature, although both of them had
done their work before Queen Victoria came to
the throne.</p>

<p><b>Henry Hallam</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1777-1859</b></span> was born at Windsor, where his
father held a canonry. His first great work,
entitled "View of the State of Europe during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Middle Ages," was published in 1818, and his
"Constitutional History of England, from the
Accession of Henry VII. to the Death of George
II.," in 1827. In 1838 he produced his "Introduction
to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth,
Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries." Of these
three works the first and the last are valuable
mainly for their stimulus to the more philosophical
and imaginative work of later writers,
but the "Constitutional History" remains the text-book
for the period which it covers. Macaulay
praised it highly, possibly because of the Whiggism
which undoubtedly underlies some of the more
debatable propositions in the book; but Macaulay
and many other writers have disputed the correctness
of many of Hallam's judgments. To write
the constitutional history of England from the
earliest period to the year 1485, where Hallam
begins, was a far more difficult undertaking than to
deal with the reigns of the Tudors and the Stuarts.
This work devolved on Dr Stubbs.</p>

<p><b>William Stubbs</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1825-</b></span>, who was appointed Bishop of
Oxford in 1889, was born at Knaresborough, and
was educated at Ripon Grammar School and at
Christ Church, Oxford. In 1850 he became vicar
of Navestock, in Essex, and in 1862 he was made
librarian at Lambeth Palace. His editions of
mediæval chronicles were well calculated to smooth
the path of any future historian, and the critical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
introductions showed the profound scholarship of
the editor. Probably no one man has done so
much to throw light on the obscure by-ways of
history, and as Regius Professor of Modern History
at Oxford, a post he accepted in 1866, he
gave so great a stimulus to historical study that
many brilliant writers have since been proud to
call him "master." In 1870 he published his
"Select Charters," of which the "Introductions"
are also invaluable, and between 1874 and 1878
he wrote his great work, "The Constitutional
History of England in its Origin and Development,"
the three volumes of which carry us down
to the death of Richard III. The book is profoundly
scientific in its method, but it is a mistaken,
although popular, belief which classes Dr
Stubbs among Dryasdust investigators. The work
glows with life and interest, and is full of suggestive
parallels for modern political society.</p>

<p>The work of tracing the growth of the English
constitution, which had been so worthily begun by
Hallam, and continued in so wise and scholarly a
fashion by Bishop Stubbs, was carried on by <b>Sir
Thomas Erskine May </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1815-1886</b></span>, who, a few days before his
death, was created Baron Farnborough. After a
long official career in connection with the House
of Commons, he was appointed Clerk to the House
in 1871. In addition to several publications dealing
with Parliamentary forms, and a book on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
"Democracy in Europe," he wrote a "Constitutional
History since the Accession of George III.,"
thus continuing the work from the point at which
Hallam had dropped it, and completing a continuous
history of the English Constitution.</p>

<p>When we turn to what is more popularly understood
by the history of a country, the political and
social life of peoples, and the wars and conquests
of nations, we are not less fortunate in the results
attained. <b>John Lingard </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1771-1851</b></span> had, it is true, written his
great work before 1837. "The History of England,
from the First Invasion by the Romans to
the Commencement of the Reign of William
III.," appeared in eight volumes between 1819 and
1830. Lingard was the son of a Winchester carpenter.
He was for some time the Professor
of Moral Philosophy at a Roman Catholic
College. His religious views doubtless affected,
in considerable measure, his judgment of events,
especially in the reign of Henry VIII., but he is a
fairly impartial historian. He confesses that he
has been more anxious to arrive at the facts than
troubled as to the garb in which those facts were
presented to the public, and his work is really very
dull in consequence. A contemporary of Lingard,
who covered much of the same historic ground, was
Sharon Turner (1768-1847), and yet another was
<b>John Mitchell Kemble </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1807-1857</b></span>, whose "Saxons in England"
(1849) still fills a useful place. Another distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
writer, of what we may term the earlier
school of historical research, was <b>Sir Francis
Palgrave </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1788-1861</b></span>, one of whose accomplished sons, Francis
Turner Palgrave, is still living (born 1824), whilom
Professor of Poetry at Oxford and the friend of
Tennyson, the author of excellent verse, and,
moreover, the editor of that incomparable volume,
the "Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics." Sir
Francis was the son of a Jewish stockbroker
named Cohen, and changed his name on becoming
a Christian. His best book, the "History of
Normandy and of England," lost much of its
value by the publication of Freeman's monumental
work, "The History of the Norman Conquest."</p>

<p><b>Edward Augustus Freeman </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1823-1892</b></span> was born at Harborne,
in Staffordshire, and educated at Trinity
College, Oxford. His first work was a "History of
Architecture," published in 1849. In 1863 he
issued the first volume of a "History of Federal
Government." The "History of the Norman
Conquest," in five large volumes, appeared
between 1867 and 1876, and the "Reign of
William Rufus, and Accession of Henry I.," in
1882. His "Old English History" was a most
delightful collection of the primitive stories which
have always had a great fascination for beginners
in history. There was scarcely any period of European
history with which the author of the "Norman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Conquest" did not show a thorough familiarity.
No historian has had a keener grasp of hard
solid facts, or is more able to make common-sense
deductions from them. "I am quite unable," he
candidly confessed, "to appreciate physical or
metaphysical works in any language," and he hated
literary discussion, which he contemptuously termed
"Chatter about Harriet," in reference to the debatable
question of Shelley's treatment of his
wife. Perhaps this lack of breadth did not
materially spoil him for his work. Of his
many volumes of histories and essays, those on
the "Norman Conquest" must be given the
first place. It has been said, indeed, that the
work takes as long to read as the event took to
achieve, but it is worth reading nevertheless.
The battle of Hastings, or, as Mr Freeman would
say, of Senlac, was a turning-point in our national
history, and we have here the most complete
description of that great struggle. Since Freeman's
death some attempt has been made to
question his accuracy and his scholarship; but
it has not amounted to very much. When Dr
Stubbs, with whom difference of political views
has in no way impaired a lifelong friendship, was
appointed Bishop of Chester in 1884, Mr Freeman
succeeded him as Regius Professor of Modern
History at Oxford, where he was followed on his
death by Mr Froude.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>It would be hard to find a greater contrast,
both in method and in manner, than between
Edward Freeman and James Anthony Froude.
Freeman's style, though clear and trenchant,
was never brilliant; Froude's language compares
with that of the best artists in literature. Freeman
was always scrupulously exact, never at fault
in a fact or a date; Froude was notoriously
careless, and slipped at every turn. Freeman
cared nothing for theories; Froude was never
so happy as when he stopped abruptly in a description
to discourse on the mysteries of Providence
or the follies of mankind. Between men
of such opposite natures no friendship was possible,
and in the <i>Saturday Review</i> and other periodicals
Freeman commented vigorously, and not always
fairly, on the other's inaccuracy.</p>

<p><b>James Anthony Froude </b><span class="sidenote"><b>1818-1894</b></span> was one of three gifted
brothers, another being William Froude (1810-1879),
the mathematician and engineer; and the
third, Richard Hurrell Froude (1803-1836), a
leader of the Tractarian movement, whose
"Literary Remains" were published after his
death by Keble and Newman. Froude was
educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and for a
time came under the influence of the movement
of which his elder brother was a leading spirit,
but ultimately he abandoned supernatural Christianity
altogether, substituting for it a kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
poetic Theism which he partly adopted from
Carlyle. In 1847 he published anonymously two
novels, "The Spirit's Trials" and "The Lieutenant's
Daughter," which contained some not very generous
criticisms on his brother and former friends. His
"Nemesis of Faith," which appeared in 1848, was
a further criticism of the doctrines which he had
abandoned. Between the years 1856 and 1869 he
published the twelve volumes of his great work,
"The History of England, from the Fall of Wolsey
to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada," which
achieved a great and, in many respects, a well-deserved
popularity. Rarely indeed has history
been written with so much brilliancy and picturesque
power. The earlier volumes have been much
discredited among historical students: yet we would
not willingly miss such delightful word-painting as
his description of the Pilgrimage of Grace and
other scenes in the career of the Eighth Henry,
whom he selected for rehabilitation. It was, of
course, a vain and impossible task to remove the
odium which has settled upon the name of
Henry VIII.; but it was as well that the attempt
should be made. Henry had appeared to the
mass of modern Englishmen as an old-world ogre,
and Mr Froude has at least enabled them to see
that he was after all a man. Mr Freeman, himself
the most conscientious and laborious of writers,
expressed his hearty contempt for an author who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
professed in the preface to his history that he took
up the subject because he had "nothing better to
do." As, however, Froude warmed to his work his
book increased in value, and there are few who will
deny the most sterling worth to his "Edward VI.,"
"Mary," and "Elizabeth." His escape from Tractarianism
had made him unfriendly to all kindred
movements, and his views of the struggle between
Catholicism and Evangelicalism in the sixteenth
century are more worthy of a Puritan divine than
of an academic writer of our own day. But we can
forgive all this, and much more, to one who has
described with so much delicate fancy the adventurous
life of Drake and Hawkins, the intrigues of
the Scottish Queen, and the restless fickleness and
untruthfulness of Elizabeth. His exquisite literary
style and general breadth of sympathy are shown
in such passages as his sketch of the rise of
Protestantism and the execution of More and
Fisher:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whilst we exult in that chivalry with which the
Smithfield martyrs bought England's freedom with
their blood, so we will not refuse our admiration to
those other gallant men whose high forms, in the
sunset of the old faith, stand transfigured on the
horizon, tinged with the light of its dying glory."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Inaccuracy and tactlessness, however, seemed to
haunt Mr Froude like evil spirits. He wrote a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
series of articles on Thomas à Becket, but the
numerous mistakes and misstatements brought
down on him once again the strictures of Mr
Freeman. He wrote a biography of Carlyle, to
whom he acted as literary executor, and the whole
of the literary world was in arms at the revelations
of Carlyle's somewhat unamiable relations with his
wife, and of his too contemptuous sentiments about
many personal friends. Still, Mr Froude's great
literary faculty will secure to this biography a far
greater permanence than will fall to the lot of the
thousand-and-one memoirs which have appeared
during the reign. Even should Carlyle's writings
cease to be generally studied, it is not improbable
that Froude's "Life of Carlyle" will always be
read as an important chapter in literary history.
In this connection I cannot do better than quote
from an unpublished letter from Sir Fitz James
Stephen, Mr Froude's co-executor, to Mr Froude:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For about fifteen years I was the intimate
friend and constant companion of both you and
Mr Carlyle, and never in my life did I see any one
man so much devoted to any other as you were to
him during the whole of that period of time. The
most affectionate son could not have acted better
to the most venerated father. You cared for him,
soothed him, protected him as a guide might protect
a weak old man down a steep and painful
path. The admiration you habitually expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
for him both morally and intellectually was unqualified.
You never said to me one ill-natured
word about him down to this day. It is to me
wholly incredible that anything but a severe regard
for truth, learnt to a great extent from his teaching,
could ever have led you to embody in your portrait
of him a delineation of the faults and weaknesses
which mixed with his great qualities.</p>

<p>"Of him I will make only one remark in justice
to you. He did not use you well. He threw upon
you the responsibility of a decision which he ought
to have taken himself in a plain, unmistakable way.
He considered himself bound to expiate the wrongs
which he had done to his wife. If he had done
this himself it would have been a courageous thing;
but he did not do it himself. He did not even
decide for himself that it should be done after his
death. If any courage was shown in the matter, it
was shown by you, and not by him. You took the
responsibility of deciding for him that it ought to
be done. You took the odium of doing it, of
avowing to the world the faults and weaknesses of
one whom you regarded as your teacher and
master. In order to present to the world a true
picture of him as he really was, you, well knowing
what you were about, stepped into a pillory in
which you were charged with treachery, violation
of confidence, and every imaginable base motive,
when you were in fact guilty of no other fault than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
that of practising Mr Carlyle's great doctrine that
men ought to tell the truth."</p>

<p>Mr Froude has other claims to remembrance.
In his "Short Studies on Great Subjects," many of
them essays written for <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, of which
he was for a long time editor, are some very wise
and thoughtful papers, particularly one on the Book
of Job. His "Life of Bunyan" is characteristic, as
is also his "Life of Cæsar." Carlyle taught him
hero-worship, and from Carlyle also he learnt the
disposition which inspired his powerful book, "The
English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century."</p>

<p>He also wrote two picturesque books of travel,
and three volumes of lectures<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> delivered at Oxford
during his occupancy of the chair of history, which
had been previously held in succession by his two
great rivals, Bishop Stubbs and Dr Freeman.</p>

<p>The historian who devoted himself most earnestly
to Mr Froude's chief historical period, and
whose writings were in some measure a reply to
his, was the <b>Rev. John Sherren Brewer</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1810-1879</b></span>, who for
many years was Professor of English Literature at
King's College, London. Brewer's chief work, a
"Calendar of Letters and Papers, Foreign and
Domestic, of the Reign of Henry VIII.," comes
down, however, to 1530, the year in which Mr
Froude's history commences, and thus Brewer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
stands alone as an authority on Henry's early reign.
A compressed work in one volume, "The Reign
of Henry VIII.," was published after his death.
Mr Froude concludes his narrative at the year
1588, the year of the Spanish Armada, but no
recent writer of mark has treated of the closing
years of Elizabeth's reign in any detail, although
we owe to Major Martin Hume a well-written
study entitled "The Year after the Armada." Major
Hume, who is the best living authority upon this
period, has also written upon "The Courtships of
Queen Elizabeth," and has edited for the Public
Record Office the Calendar of Spanish State
Papers of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="p2">The next great period of English history, that
of the Stuart kings, is dealt with by Professor
Gardiner. <b>Samuel Rawson Gardiner</b> (<b>1829-</b> ) was born at
Ropley, in Hampshire, and was educated at Winchester
and at Christ Church, Oxford. His whole
life has been devoted to the most laborious research
in the annals of the reigns of James I.,
Charles I., and the Protectorate of Cromwell.
He has not, like Mr Froude, taken up history as a
pleasant literary recreation, but has given years of unremitting
labour to the production of each separate
volume. He is now well into the study of the
Protectorate, the first volume of his history of which
appeared in 1894. He has written many minor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
books, one dealing with "The Gunpowder Plot,"
and another with "Cromwell's Place in History."
Mr Gardiner will not perhaps be counted a brilliant
writer. He gives us none of the fire and eloquence,
almost bordering on poetry, which we find so
abundantly in Froude; but he has been described
by Sir John Seeley as the only historian who has
trodden the controversial ground of seventeenth-century
English political history with absolute
fairness and impartiality. James and Charles,
Buckingham and Bristol, Strafford and Pym,
stand out in clear and well-defined lineaments.
There is no hero-worship to blind us; no flowing
rhetoric to atone for insufficient knowledge. We
see these men in their weakness and in their
strength, neither side monopolising the virtue and
the patriotism, but each, on occasion, acting from
noble or ignoble motives. It may be urged that
too much attention is devoted to the follies of
princes and the intrigues of courtiers, and certainly
of the inner life of the nation we get all too
little in Mr Gardiner's pages: but it may be fairly
said that these books are the safest and best of
guides to one of the most important and critical
periods in our political history. It is impossible to
avoid contrasting Mr Gardiner with a far more
popular and more brilliant historian, Lord Macaulay,
and the contrast is, in some respects, in
favour of the former. Mr Gardiner sees that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
dealing with the complexities of human motives we
are on very uncertain and delicate ground. We
need to pause step by step to weigh probabilities
and to qualify our every statement, although such
hesitancy and qualification is not conducive to
brilliant writing.</p>

<p class="p2">The importance of this rhetorical principle was
fully grasped by <b>Thomas Babington Macaulay</b>, (<b>1800-1859</b>)
and, accordingly, in his writings a single definite
and distinct motive is seized upon as the guiding
principle of every action, and, by the simple plan
of ignoring complexities in human character, we
are carried along in an easy manner to positive
and undoubting opinions. "I wish," said Lord
Melbourne, "that I were as cock-sure of <i>anything</i>
as Tom Macaulay is of everything;" and the
remark hit off an undoubted failing, at least from
the standpoint of sound and trustworthy workmanship.
Macaulay, whose father was a distinguished
philanthropist and slavery abolitionist, was born at
Rothley Temple, in Leicestershire. From a private
school he went to Trinity College, Cambridge.
His earliest efforts in literature were articles for
Knight's <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>, and contributions
to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the first of which, on
"Milton," drew from Lord Jeffrey the remark,
"The more I think the less I can conceive where
you picked up that style." Perhaps Macaulay's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
essays have been more popular even than his history.
The extraordinary knowledge they display, the
discursive familiarity with all poetry and fiction,
ancient and modern, and their enthusiastic interest
in historical events, make them a kind of education
to men whose reading has been slight, or who are
beginners in the art of reading&mdash;an art at which
Macaulay was such an adept. In 1830 Macaulay
entered Parliament as member for Calne, and
four years later received the post of member of
the Indian Council at Calcutta, with a salary of
£10,000 a year. He left India in 1838, having
rendered great service to that country by assisting
to frame the Indian penal code. After his
return to England he sat in Parliament for many
years as member for Edinburgh, and for a short
time held a seat in Lord Melbourne's Cabinet.
Some of his speeches in the House were among
the most eloquent and successful to which that
assembly has listened. In 1849 the first two
volumes of his "History of England from the
Accession of James II." were published. The
great success of these and the succeeding volumes
made him one of the most popular authors of his
day. In 1857 Macaulay was made a Peer, but he
never spoke in the House of Lords. He died in
December 1859, before he had finished the
"Reign of William III.," and was buried in
Westminster Abbey. During the later years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Macaulay's life, and for many years after his death,
he received the unstinted praise, not only of the
great mass of readers, but even of cultured brother
authors. Of late years this has changed; a reaction
has set in, and perhaps the time has not
yet come to assign to him his true place in
literature. When Sir George Trevelyan's admirable
life of his uncle appeared in 1876, a number of
eminent writers based upon that book a criticism
of Macaulay's work. Mr Gladstone wrote in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, Mr Leslie Stephen in the
<i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, and Mr John Morley in the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i>. In each separate case the
review was unfavourable. All alike agreed as to
his high qualities as a man; his sincerity,
generosity, kindliness, and purity, his love of
children and his brotherly devotion; but each in
turn found matter for censure in his work. One
condemned his style, another his Whig partialities,
another his boundless optimism, and another his
errors of judgment or alleged misstatements of facts.
It is true that Macaulay is sometimes inaccurate, that
he is not seldom unjust to the characters whom he
paints so vividly. It is now a commonplace to say
that his history was written, as Carlyle said, "to
prove that Providence was on the side of the Whigs."
It is clear that he was a man of strong literary
prejudices, and he undoubtedly owes much of his
popularity to the fact that he expresses in grandly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
rhetorical language the average sentiment of his
day, its belief in material prosperity, and its delight
in being told that there has been no age of
the world so happy as our own. All this is true,
and yet it is also true that Macaulay's real services
to literature are lost sight of when such an estimate
is propounded too harshly.</p>

<p>In spite of obvious deficiencies, Macaulay's
history is a great work. It fills up a gap in
historical literature, and such incidents as the
trial of the seven bishops and the siege of
Londonderry excel both in picturesqueness and
in accuracy. But Macaulay has claims far beyond
his merits as a historian. The critics who condemn
him so freely seem to have forgotten their
own early years. "If I am in the wrong," said
Macaulay of his history, "I shall at least have
set the minds of others at work." He has set the
minds of others at work. What cultivated man or
woman lives, with whom Macaulay's writings have
not been among the first books read, who has not
been made to feel that all the great poetry, and
fiction, and history to which he alludes so freely
must be well worth careful study? What matter
if in after-years we discover that Macaulay was
unjust to Bacon the man, and was entirely ignorant
of Bacon the philosopher; or understand clearly
what he meant by saying that such critiques as
Lessing's "Laocoon" "filled him with wonder and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
despair?" If we have been encouraged by him to
desire a wider knowledge, if we have learnt from
him to admire so many great writers, so many
famous statesmen, we may surely forgive him
much, if indeed there be anything to forgive.</p>

<p><b>Earl Stanhope</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1805-1875</b></span>, who did most of his historical
work when, as an expectant peer, he was known as
Lord Mahon, was a great friend of Macaulay's. In
1870 he published a "History of the Reign of
Queen Anne," which began at the year 1701,
and thus served as a connecting link between
Macaulay's history and his own larger work&mdash;the
"History of England, from the Peace of Utrecht
down to the Peace of Versailles (1713-1783)."
The continuation of Earl Stanhope's narrative
may be found either in Mr Lecky's "Eighteenth
Century," or in <b>William Nathaniel Massey's</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1881</b></span> "History
of England under George III." Mr Massey
brings us down to the Peace of Amiens in 1801,
from which date Harriet Martineau leads us to 1846
in a work ("History of the Peace") which is quite
unworthy of her abilities. The reign of Victoria
has been written by many hands, not the least
successful being the "History of England, 1830-1873"
of the <b>Rev. William Nassau Molesworth</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1816-1890</b></span>
of Rochdale, the author also of a "History of the
Church of England." Equally popular is the
"History of Our Own Time, 1830-1897," of <b>Justin
MacCarthy</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1830-</b></span>, who has also written a "History of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the Four Georges," and many popular novels.
Nor must we forget the brilliant literary effort
of <b>Alexander William Kinglake</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1811-1891</b></span> who, in his
"History of the War in the Crimea," has made
a younger generation familiar with a struggle in
which their fathers took so brave a part. Mr
Kinglake was for some years the Liberal member
for Bridgewater. His first literary effort, "Eothen,"
a volume of travels, is scarcely less popular than his
history. By far the most important work, however,
on English history, in a period subsequent to that
dealt with by Macaulay, is Lecky's "History of
England in the Eighteenth Century," a work of
great thoroughness and thoughtfulness, the eighth
and concluding volume of which was published in
1890. <b>William Edward Hartpole Lecky</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-</b></span>, who was
educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which he now
represents in Parliament, is one of the most brilliant
and suggestive writers of our age. His "Rise
and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism," and
"European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne,"
as well as the "History of the Eighteenth Century,"
are justly popular.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enumerate all the important
contributions to historical study of the past few
years, but the "History of Scotland, from the
Invasion of Agricola to the Revolution of 1688,"
by <b>John Hill Burton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1881</b></span>, and the "Life and Reign of
Richard III.," by James Gairdner must not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
forgotten, nor the "History of the War in the
Peninsula," by Sir Charles Napier (1786-1860).
Many writers have embodied the main conclusions
of the historians we have named, in brief,
but useful, histories for the use of the more
advanced schools. The more successful of these
are the Rev. James Franck Bright and the late
John Richard Green. <b>James Franck Bright</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1832-</b></span> is
master of University College, Oxford, and his
"English History for the use of Public Schools"
is a work so lucidly and carefully written, that it is
entitled to be lifted out of the category of mere
text-books, and to take rank as good literature.
Still more is this true of Green's "Short History
of the English People." <b>John Richard Green</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1837-1883</b></span>
was born at Oxford, and educated at Magdalen
College School and at Jesus College. For
some time he was vicar of St Philip's, Stepney.
His "Short History," published in 1874, was
speedily adopted in schools, and had an enormous
sale among general readers. It was immediately
recognised that a brilliant writer had appeared,
one who had assimilated all that was worthy in
the work of laborious contemporary historians,
had himself made much study of original documents,
and had welded all together by the power
of real genius. A critic here and there devoted
himself to discovering the errors, mainly of dates,
which, owing to the illness of the author, disfigured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the first edition. But the popular instinct which
declared this to be a great work, was a sound one.
In the main its conclusions are just. There is not
a line of cheap sentiment or rhetorical clap-trap
in the book. Mr Green soon afterwards enlarged
his work, and published it in four handsome
volumes, which he dedicated to his friends&mdash;"My
Masters in the Study of English History,"&mdash;Bishop
Stubbs and Professor Freeman. Later on appeared
"The Making of England," and, after his decease,
another volume, "The Conquest of England,"
written on his deathbed, was published by his
widow, Alice Stopford Green, who has written
"Town Life in the Fifteenth Century." Sir Archibald
Geikie, the geologist, once rendered a tribute
to Green for endeavouring to bring geological
science to the aid of historical research; but on
the question of the Teutonic element in our nation,
it has been urged that Green follows his friends,
Stubbs and Freeman, all too readily, and ignores
the evidence from anthropology in favour of the
very great prevalence of Celtic blood in the
English-speaking race.</p>

<p>I regret that my space will not permit me to
write at length of the men who have studied so
thoroughly sciences which have so much bearing
upon history, and who have written delightful
books upon them. I must be content merely to
mention the names of William Boyd Dawkins, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
has written "Cave-hunting" and "Early Man in
Britain;" and Sir John Lubbock, banker and
member of Parliament, who has written "Pre-historic
Times" and "The Origin of Civilization
and the Primitive Condition of Man," also
various books on natural science, and some
very inadequate literary essays. Nor must I forget
Edward Burnett Tylor's "Primitive Culture"
and "Anthropology," Grant Allen's "Anglo-Saxon
Britain," and Edward Clodd's "Childhood of the
World," "Childhood of Religion," and "Pioneers
of Evolution." From such works as these it is
but a very short step to the writings of Max
Müller. <b>Friedrich Max Müller</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1823-</b></span>, son of the
German poet, Wilhelm Müller, was educated at
the University of Leipzig, and made a special
study of philosophy in Germany for many years
before he came to the land of his adoption, in
1846. Appointed an Oxford professor, first of
modern languages and later of comparative philology,
a science which he may almost be said to
have created, he has become an Englishman both
in speech and in writing. Max Müller's most
popular works are his interesting "Lectures on the
Science of Language," and his "Chips from a
German Workshop," in which he deals not only
with the common origin of the world's leading
languages, but in a skilful and almost startling
manner reconstructs, by the aid of language alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the conditions out of which have risen the various
religious and social systems of the early nations.
The writers who have most prominently followed
in Max Müller's footsteps, as elucidators of
primitive religious belief, are Professor Sayce and
the Rev. Sir George Cox. <b>Archibald Henry
Sayce</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1846-</b></span>, who succeeded Max Müller in the chair
of comparative philology at Oxford, has written
numerous books and treatises dealing with the
Chaldean and other ancient nations, and has also
published an annotated edition of Herodotus,
noticeable chiefly for its unfavourable verdict on
the "Father of History." <b>Sir George Cox</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1827-</b></span>, whose
"Mythology of the Aryan Nations" has provoked
much adverse criticism from its extreme
application of the "Solar" theory to the interpretation
of myth, epic, and romance, has also
written an interesting "History of Greece" in
two volumes.</p>

<p>The "History of Greece" which may be considered
one of the most satisfactory achievements
of the Victorian era, is that by Grote, published in
twelve volumes. <b>George Grote</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1794-1871</b></span> was born at Clay
Hill, near Beckenham, and was educated at the
Charterhouse School. He early went into the
banking-house in Threadneedle Street, of which
his father was one of the partners, but found time
to devote himself to philosophy and history, and
to write for the <i>Westminster Review</i>, the organ of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
philosophical Radicalism. It was as a representative
of this phase of thought that he was returned
as member of Parliament for the city of London
in 1833. He sat in the House as one of a small
body of philosophical Radicals until 1841, bringing
forward annually a resolution in favour of the
ballot. He retired from Parliamentary life to
devote himself more energetically to his "History
of Greece," the first two volumes of which appeared
in 1846; the twelfth, and last, which takes
us to the death of Alexander the Great, was published
in 1856. During the same years, but unknown
to Grote, <b>Connop Thirlwall</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1797-1875</b></span>, Bishop of St
David's, a former schoolfellow of his, was engaged
upon the same task. Each acknowledged the
superiority of his rival's work, and Grote said that
he should never have written his had Thirlwall's
book appeared a few years earlier; but there can
be little hesitation in assigning the higher place to
Grote. Of Thirlwall it may be said, however, that
but for Grote his history would have taken high
rank, and would have been a welcome relief from
the foolish but once popular work of William
Mitford. Thirlwall is also interesting for having
translated, in 1825, Schleiermacher's "Essay on
St Luke," and thus first introduced German theology
into England. Grote's history is a book of
high educational value. In it we have all that
is best in Herodotus, Thucydides, and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
ancient historians, added to the sound and weighty
judgment of a clear-sighted modern critic, exceptionally
free from prejudice. It was Grote's great
destiny to free the English mind from the erroneous
impressions which had so long prevailed as to
the real character of the Athenian democracy, and
we cannot find elsewhere a truer or juster picture
of Athens at the height of her power. A great
work on Greek history in later aspects than those
of Grote and Thirlwall is "A History of Greece,
from its Conquest by the Romans to the Present
Time," by <b>George Finlay</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1799-1875</b></span>. Finlay fought in the
Greek War of Independence, and lived for the
greater part of his life in Athens.</p>

<p>A number of clergymen besides Dr Thirlwall
have shown an able grasp of classical history.
Dr Arnold wrote a "History of Rome," based on
Niebuhr, which, although interesting, is scarcely
worthy of so great a man. <b>Charles Merivale</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1808-1893</b></span>, Dean
of Ely, wrote an admirable summary of Roman
history from the foundation of the city in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 753
to the fall of Augustulus in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 476; but his great
work is the "History of the Romans under the
Empire," which is indispensable for a thorough
appreciation of Gibbon. <b>Henry Hart Milman</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1791-1868</b></span>,
Dean of St Paul's, did good service to historical
scholarship by his edition of Gibbon's pre-eminent
work, and by his own "History of the Jews,"
"History of Christianity under the Empire," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
"Latin Christianity." The nine volumes of this
last were called by Dean Stanley "a complete epic
and philosophy of mediæval Christianity." Milman
is said to have described himself as "the last
learned man in the Church," but in the presence of
so eminent a scholar as <b>Mandell Creighton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1843-</b></span>, Bishop
of London, the statement is meaningless. Dr
Creighton's great work, "A History of the Papacy
From the Great Schism to the Sack of Rome," is
of the highest value in the consecutive study of
European history; and so also is the work of
another clergyman, <b>George William Kitchin</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1827-</b></span>, Dean
of Durham, whose "History of France previous to
the Revolution," is very attractively written.</p>

<p>A writer who generalises freely from the facts
of history, and whose generalisations were once
very popular, and, according to Sir Mackenzie
Wallace, are still widely read in Russia, was <b>Henry
Thomas Buckle</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1821-1862</b></span>, who published in 1857 the first
volume of the "History of Civilisation in England;"
a second volume appeared in 1861, but the author
died before he had completed his intended undertaking.
Buckle unduly emphasises the influence of
national and moral laws upon the progress of civilisation,
minimises the influence of individuals, and
overlooks the momentous action of heredity. A
writer of equal importance with Buckle was <b>John
Addington Symonds</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1840-1893</b></span>, whose "Renaissance in
Italy" is a work of great literary merit, and whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
translation of Cellini's "Autobiography" has
superseded Roscoe's.</p>

<p>Passing from historic Italy to Germany we may
note that "The Holy Roman Empire" of <b>James
Bryce</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-</b></span> created quite a <i>furore</i> as a prize essay at
Oxford, and, in its enlarged shape, forms the only
English sketch of German history of great literary
merit. Mr Bryce was, some years ago, announced
to write a "History of Germany" of more formidable
dimensions, but the glamour of parliamentary life
and a seat in the Cabinet have robbed us of a
capable historian. Although we are without a
satisfactory German history we possess two very
solid contributions to such a work. With one
of these, Carlyle's "Frederick II.," I shall deal
later; the other is <b>Sir John Robert Seeley's</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1834-1895</b></span>
"Life and Times of Stein; or, Germany and Prussia in
the Napoleonic Age." When this work appeared
it was received with high commendation in Germany,
but in England with the qualification that it
had none of the literary charm of the author's
earlier efforts. To such criticism Professor Seeley&mdash;he
received the professorship of modern history
at Cambridge on Kingsley's resignation in 1869&mdash;replied
in a series of papers entitled "History and
Politics," wherein he practically contended that it
was the business of historians to be dull, and that
brilliant history-writing was, as a matter of fact,
little other than fiction. Still, in his lectures on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
"The Expansion of England" (1883) and "A
Short History of Napoleon" (1886) he succeeded
in making himself entirely interesting.</p>

<p>The books which gave Sir John Seeley his
greatest fame&mdash;he received a knighthood in 1893&mdash;were
not, however, historical, but, in a sense, theological;
and with him we find ourselves in the
midst of the great religious controversies of the
reign. "Ecce Homo; a Survey of the Life and
Work of Jesus Christ," was published anonymously
in 1865. While censured on many sides on
account of its alleged heterodoxy, it drew from
opponents unstinted admiration on account of its
perfect literary workmanship. One of these
opponents was Mr Gladstone, who ventured the
prophecy that the author would at a later period
write something from a more orthodox standpoint.
The prediction was not verified, for in 1882 a
further work, "Natural Religion," by the Author
of "Ecce Homo," showed still less sympathy with
the supernatural side of religion.</p>

<p>Mr Gladstone, who flung himself into this as into
so many other controversies, has a fame quite apart
from any literary achievement. But whatever
posterity may say of his influence on the destinies
of the nation which he has helped for so many
years to rule, it is certain that his powers as an
author would have made the reputation of a man
of less versatility.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p><b>William Ewart Gladstone</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-</b></span>, the son of a Lancashire
merchant, was born at Liverpool. Into
his political career it is not my province to
enter. His first literary work, "The State in its
Relations with the Church," was made famous
through a review by Macaulay. Later in life he
indulged in theological controversy, publishing
an "Essay on Ritualism" and "The Vatican
Decrees." Mr Gladstone's chief work is, however,
his "Studies in Homer," in which he argues for
the unity of the poem, for the foundation in fact
of its main incidents, and for the definite personality
of the author. His contributions to periodical
literature have been innumerable, and only a few&mdash;and
those non-controversial and non-classical&mdash;have
been republished in his five volumes of
"Gleanings." Mr Gladstone's chief opponent in
theological controversy, Cardinal Newman, has
profoundly influenced his religious views. "In
my opinion," wrote Mr Gladstone many years after
Newman had become a Roman Catholic, "his
secession from the Church of England has never
yet been estimated among us at anything like the
full amount of its calamitous importance. It has
been said that the world does not know its greatest
men; neither, I will add, is it aware of the power
and weight carried by the words and the acts of
those among its greatest men whom it does know.
The ecclesiastical historian will perhaps hereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
judge that this secession was a much greater event
even than the partial secession of John Wesley, the
only case of personal loss suffered by the Church
of England since the Reformation which can be at
all compared with it in magnitude."</p>

<p><b>John Henry Newman</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1801-1890</b></span> was born in London, and
educated at a private school at Ealing and at
Trinity College, Oxford. Inclined at first to the
liberal Christianity which men like Whately and
Milman were furthering among churchmen, he
was, he says, "rudely awakened by two great
blows&mdash;illness and bereavement"; and he devoted
himself to a life-long opposition to what he has
called "the great apostasy&mdash;liberalism in religion."
"My battle," he writes, "was with liberalism; by
liberalism I mean the anti-dogmatic principle and
its developments." From 1828 to 1843 he held
the incumbency of St Mary's Church, Oxford, and
the influence which he then exerted was of the
deepest moment for the future of religious life in
England. "Who," says Matthew Arnold, himself,
like his father before him, one of the leaders
of the movement which Newman has hated
so intensely, "who could resist the charm of that
spiritual apparition, gliding in the dim afternoon
light through the aisles of St Mary's, rising into
the pulpit, and then, in the most entrancing of
voices, breaking the silence with words and
thoughts which were a religious music&mdash;subtle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
sweet, mournful? I seem to hear him still, saying:
'After the fever of life, after wearinesses
and sicknesses, fightings and despondings, languor
and fretfulness, struggling and succeeding; after
all the changes and chances of this troubled, unhealthy
state,&mdash;at length comes death, at length
the white throne of God, at length the beatific
vision.'" During these years at St Mary's what is
called the Tractarian movement sprang to life&mdash;a
movement, as we have said, against Broad-Churchism.
It was at the beginning of the movement, on
his way home from Sicily in 1833, whilst pondering
over the difficulties of the task he had undertaken,
that Newman wrote the hymn "Lead, kindly Light,"
which is now as popular in the most advanced and
liberalized churches as it can be in those nearest
to its author's religious standpoint. The "Tracts
for the Times," whence Tractarians derived their
name, were written by Newman, Hurrell Froude,
Pusey, and others. Bishop Bloomfield said that
the whole movement was nothing but Newmania.
The writers argued now in short papers, now in
elaborate treatises, for the Divine mission of the
Anglican Church. Not till "Tract XC." was reached
did the alarm of the Protestant party manifest
itself in any practical form. In that Tract
Newman declared that subscription to the
Thirty-nine Articles was not inconsistent with
the acceptance of Roman Catholic teaching on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
purgatory, on the invocation of saints, and on the
mass. The Hebdomadal Council of the University
condemned the Tract. Two years later Newman
resigned his position at St Mary's, and in 1845
formally joined the Church of Rome. According to
Disraeli, Anglicanism "reeled under the shock," and
Dean Stanley remarked to a friend that the fortunes
of the English Church might have been very different
"had Newman been able to read German."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In 1848 he was appointed head of the Birmingham
Oratory, and there he resided&mdash;with one short
break as rector of the Roman Catholic University
at Dublin&mdash;for nearly forty years. In 1879 he was
created a cardinal, and his visit to Rome and installation
as a Prince of the Sacred College excited
much attention in England. Although by temperament
and inclination one of the least combative
and most retiring of men, Cardinal Newman found
himself again and again in the thick of the argumentative
fray. At one time he was involved in
a libel action by an ex-priest and ultra-Protestant
lecturer named Father Achilli, and this cost Newman
and his friends twelve thousand pounds; at
another time he was arguing with the foremost
English statesman, Mr Gladstone, as to the probable
loyalty of English Roman Catholics if the
Papacy and the English Government were brought
into collision. In one great controversy of his life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
he was generally admitted to have achieved a success,
and this success is associated with an enduring
literary work, the autobiography which he calls
his "Apologia pro Vitâ Suâ." Reviewing Froude's
"History of England" in <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>
(January 1864), Charles Kingsley charged Newman
with being careless about truth, and with
teaching that cunning and not truth-seeking was the
acceptable method of the Roman Catholic clergy.
Brought to bay by Newman, Kingsley contradicted
himself in an amazing fashion, and even
the most enthusiastic Protestants were compelled
to admit that the clever novelist was no match for
the trained dialectician. Mrs Kingsley, in her
charming life of her husband, practically admits that
he was worsted in the conflict, and J. A. Froude,
his brother-in-law, wrote: "Kingsley entirely
misunderstood Newman's character. Newman's
whole life had been a struggle for truth. He had
neglected his own interests; he had never thought
of them at all. He had brought to bear a most
powerful and subtle intellect to support the convictions
of a conscience which was superstitiously
sensitive. His single object had been to discover
what were the real relations between man and his
Maker, and to shape his own conduct by the conclusions
at which he arrived. To represent such
a person as careless of truth was neither generous
nor even reasonable."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>The final outcome of the controversy was the
publication of the "Apologia," a work which, alike
in beauty of style and devotion of spirit, must be
assigned a very high place in religious literature.
My space is too limited to pass in review, or even
to name, the thirty-six volumes which contain the
writings of this eloquent preacher and teacher.
His "Dream of Gerontius" and "Verses on
Various Occasions" show his high qualities as
a poet; his "Apologia," "Callista," and "Essay
in aid of the Grammar of Assent," display his
genius as a prose stylist. In "Callista: a Sketch
of the Third Century," he pictures a beautiful
Greek girl, who becomes a convert to Christianity
after a severe struggle between human affection
and religious faith. The "Grammar of Assent"
is an apology for Christianity, far above the
narrow controversies in which the author took so
distinguished a part.</p>

<p class="p2">The question whether Cardinal Newman or
Carlyle has been the most influential personality
in Victorian literature will be largely decided by
the temperament of the critic. Mr Swinburne,
looking at them both from a standpoint of antagonism
to the priestly proclivities of the one
and to the tyrannical proclivities of the other,
apostrophised them jointly in the well-known
lines:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"With all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate,</p>
<p class="i1">High souls that hate us; for our hopes are higher,</p>
<p class="i1">And higher than yours the goal of our desire,</p>
<p>Though high your ends be as your hearts are great."</p>
</div>

<p>Newman, indeed, left England more dominated
by ritual than in any other period of its history,
the Roman Church more powerful than ever before,
the new High Church party in the Establishment
a great institution, with the rival Prime
Ministers, Mr Gladstone and Lord Salisbury,
among its supporters, and a taste for ritual conspicuous
in the chapels of the Nonconformists.
And yet with all this Carlyle was the more
dominant personality.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Carlyle</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1795-1881</b></span> was born at Ecclefechan, in
Dumfriesshire, on the 4th of December 1795.
His father was a stonemason, at whose death
Carlyle thus tenderly wrote in his Diary:&mdash;"I
owe him much more than existence. I owe him
a noble inspiring example. It was he <i>exclusively</i>
that determined on educating me; that from his
small hard-earned funds sent me to school and
college, and made me whatever I am and may
become. Let me not mourn for my father, let me
do worthily of him. So shall he still live, even
here in me, and his worth plant itself honourably
forth into new generations." From Annan Grammar
School the young Carlyle went to Edinburgh
University, where he became a voracious reader,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
although never a great classical scholar. He then
took the post of mathematical tutor at Annan
school, and afterwards at Kirkcaldy, where he
was friendly with Edward Irving, afterwards the
famous preacher. Disgusted with this life he flung
up his appointment, and determined to study for
the law. For some time he eked out a scanty
subsistence in Edinburgh by writing biographies
for Brewster's <i>Encyclopædia</i>. It was at this period
that he obtained some measure of mental and
moral stimulus from his German studies. Goethe
opened a new world to him. He began to
study German in 1819, induced thereto by
Madame de Staël's interesting account of the
German poets and philosophers. Goethe was
seventy-five years old when in 1824 he received
from Carlyle an English translation of "Wilhelm
Meister," with a letter, saying, "Four years ago,
when I read your 'Faust' among the mountains
of my native Scotland, I could not but fancy I
might one day see you, and pour out before you,
as before a father, the woes and wanderings of a
heart whose mysteries you seemed so thoroughly
to comprehend, and could so beautifully represent."
Two years later Carlyle sent Goethe his "Life of
Schiller," and once again he expressed his intense
devotion to one "whose voice came to me from
afar, with counsel and help, in my utmost need."
"For if," he continues, "I have been delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
from darkness into any measure of light, if I know
aught of myself and my destination, it is to the
study of your writings more than to any other
circumstance that I owe this; it is you more than
any other man that I should always thank and
reverence with the feeling of a disciple to his
Master, nay, of a son to his spiritual Father." In
the meantime Carlyle had married Jane Welsh,
the daughter of a doctor in Haddington, and had
settled at the lonely farm-house of Craigenputtock,
in Dumfriesshire. There he was visited by Emerson,
and there he remained for six years, before
removing to London. Not only had Carlyle then
translated "Wilhelm Meister" and written the "Life
of Schiller," but he had made numerous translations
from Musæus, Tieck, and Richter, and had published
essays on these and other German authors.
Jean Paul Richter had a peculiar attraction for
him, and there can be no doubt that Carlyle owed
his extraordinary style, in some degree, to his study
of the German humorist.</p>

<p>The forty-seven years of Carlyle's London life
(1834-1881) were years of incessant literary activity.
The thirty volumes which came from his pen during
that time not only secured for him a permanent
place amongst the historians, biographers, and
essayists of our literature, but they kindled for him
a glow of intense personal enthusiasm amongst the
best of his contemporaries, such as, perhaps, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
other English author has enjoyed. At his death
on the 5th of February, 1881, the world knew
Carlyle, apart from his books, as a man of simple
tastes, content, in spite of the wealth which literary
success had brought, to reside amidst unostentatious
surroundings, ever ready to help the distressed
and needy, refusing a title and the like
official recognitions, and carrying out to the letter
the reverence, earnestness, and unobtrusive manliness
which he had inculcated in his writings; devotedly
attached to his wife, whom he described on
her tombstone as having "unweariedly forwarded
him as none else could, in all of good that he did
or attempted;" and, in short, worthy of the address
presented to him on his eightieth birthday, by nearly
all the men of literary and scientific eminence in
England, including, amongst others, Lord Tennyson
and George Eliot, Robert Browning and Professor
Huxley. "A whole generation has elapsed,"
they said, "since you described for us the hero as
a man of letters. We congratulate you and ourselves
on the spacious fulness of years which has
enabled you to sustain this rare dignity amongst
mankind in all its possible splendour and completeness."
The publication of Mr Froude's nine
volumes of memorials caused a considerable
revulsion of feeling. The Carlyle of these
"Letters" and "Reminiscences" appeared to be
over-censorious in his estimate of his contemporaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
not too considerate in his relations with
his wife, and, however admirable he might find
contentment in Richter or Heyne, not content
without much murmuring to accept a life of restricted
means.</p>

<p>To give too much emphasis to this view of
Carlyle's character is to ignore certain peculiarities
of Mr Froude's biographical and historical style, to
which reference has already been made. It will
suffice to point out here that there are other sources
of information about Carlyle than the books of his
accredited biographer. Sir Henry Taylor, Mrs
Oliphant, Mr Charles Eliot Norton, Mrs Gilchrist,
and other friends of Carlyle's later life have
published much additional matter, and have
shown, as it were, the other side of the shield.
To Sir Henry Taylor, who knew him well, he
seemed "the most faithful and true-hearted of
men," and from many sources we learn that Mr
Froude's picture is not that of the true Carlyle;
that he was not a selfish husband, that his married
life was not unhappy, that he was not altogether
dumb to the heroes living, whilst eloquent over
heroes dead, and that, in spite of many faults, he
was a noble high-minded man, a "kingly soul," as
Longfellow called him. Writing in his Diary during
his second visit to England in 1847, Emerson
says:&mdash;"Carlyle and his wife live on beautiful
terms. Their ways are very engaging, and in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
bookcase all his books are inscribed to her as they
came from year to year, each with some significant
lines."</p>

<p>The letters which Carlyle wrote to his wife at
the time she lost her mother are most touchingly
affectionate. This is what she wrote to a friend at
that time:&mdash;"In great matters he is always kind
and considerate, but these little attentions which
we women attach so much importance to, he was
never in the habit of rendering to anyone. And,
now, the desire to replace the irreplaceable makes
him as good in little things as he used to be in
great." And to Carlyle himself she writes:&mdash;"God
keep you, my dear husband, and bring you
safe back to me. The house looks very desolate
without you, and my mind feels empty too. I
expect, with impatience, the letter that is to fix
your return."</p>

<p>On another occasion, writing to her husband's
mother, she says:&mdash;"You have others behind and
I have only him&mdash;only him in the whole wide
world to love me and take care of me&mdash;poor little
wretch that I am. Not but that numbers of people
love me, after their fashion, far more than I deserve,
but then his fashion is so different from
theirs, and seems alone to suit the crotchety
creature that I am." And then her pride in her
husband is well exemplified by an experience related
in a letter to him, which shows also how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
wide and deep is that mysterious impersonal influence
of great authors on men who are totally
unknown to them:&mdash;"A man of the people
mounted the platform and spoke; a youngish,
intelligent-looking man, who alone, of all the
speakers, seemed to understand the question, and
to have feelings as well as notions about it. He
spoke with a heart-eloquence that left me warm.
I never was more affected by public speaking....
A sudden thought struck me: this man would like
to know you. I would give him my address in
London. I borrowed a piece of paper and handed
him my address. When he looked at it he started
as if I had sent a bullet into him, caught my hand,
and said, 'Oh, it is your husband! Mr Carlyle
has been my teacher and master! I have owed
everything to him for years and years!' I felt it a
credit to you really to have had a hand in turning
out this man, was prouder of that heart-tribute to
your genius than any amount of reviewers' praises
or aristocratic invitations to dinner."</p>

<p>It is because the spirit which breathes in the
words of this young workman has been the guiding
moral force of numbers of men and women in all
stations of life, during the last sixty years, that I
have devoted so much space to Carlyle. It is of
the greatest importance to literature that the man
whose eloquent preaching of justice, sincerity, and
reverence has turned the hearts of thousands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
his fellowmen towards nobility and simplicity of
life, should not himself have been out of harmony
with all that he taught. "The world," says
Thackeray's gifted daughter, "has pointed its
moral finger of late at the old man in his great
old age, accusing himself in the face of all, and
confessing the overpowering irritations which the
suffering of a lifetime had laid upon him and upon
her he loved. That old caustic man of deepest
feeling, with an ill-temper and a tender heart, and
a racking imagination, speaking from the grave,
and bearing unto it that cross of passionate remorse
which few among us dare to face, seems to some of
us now a figure nobler and truer, a teacher greater
far than in the days when all his pain and love and
remorse were still hidden from us all."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Of the "Reminiscences" which excited so much
criticism on account of their references to persons
still living, Carlyle wrote on the last page:&mdash;"I
still mainly mean to <i>burn</i> this book before my own
departure, but feel that I shall always have a kind
of grudge to do it, and an indolent excuse. 'Not
<i>yet</i>; wait, any day that can be done!' and that it
is possible the thing <i>may</i> be left behind me, legible
to interested survivors&mdash;<i>friends</i> only, I will hope,
and with <i>worthy</i> curiosity, not <i>un</i>worthy! In which
event, I solemnly forbid them, each and all, to
<i>publish</i> this bit of writing <i>as it stands here</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
warn them that <i>without fit editing</i> no <i>part</i> of it
should be printed (nor so far as I can order <i>shall</i>
ever be), and that the 'fit editing' of perhaps
nine-tenths of it will, after I am gone, have become
<i>impossible</i>."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The only editing which Mr Froude deemed "fit"
was the omission of this paragraph from his edition
of the work. And yet to read, with the "worthy
curiosity" of which he speaks, of his love for
father and wife, and of his kindly solicitude for
brothers and sisters, whom he constantly assisted,
is to make him nearer and dearer to those who
care to remember that he was after all but human.
Carlyle spoke with too little kindness, it must be
owned, of Wordsworth, and Coleridge, and Lamb,
because he saw only the palpable weaknesses of
their characters, and was blinded by forbidding
externals to the sterling worth of these great
men; but he loved Emerson, and Tennyson, and
Ruskin, and he profoundly revered Goethe, who,
after all, was the only one of his contemporaries
who could take rank anywhere near him.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Carlyle
recognised that Goethe was incomparably his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
superior in every way; that he was, as Matthew
Arnold calls him, "the greatest poet of the present
age, and the greatest critic of all ages," the one
man of transcendent genius whom Europe has
produced since Dante and Shakspere. To have
first led England to appreciate Goethe is not the
least of Carlyle's many services to his country. To
have acted as an inspiring and helpful prophet is
perhaps his greatest. "Sartor Resartus" first appeared
in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for 1833, where it
met with but scanty recognition, and, indeed, half-ruined
the editor, whose subscribers anxiously
asked when the "tailor sketches" were coming to
an end. It is surely something more than a passing
fashion in literature which leads us now to take
up these well-worn pages with so much of tenderness
and sympathy. "There is in man," he says,
"a Higher than Love of Happiness; he can do
without Happiness, and instead thereof find
Blessedness! Was it not to preach forth this
same Higher that sages and martyrs, the Poet and
the Priest, in all times, have spoken and suffered;
bearing testimony, through life and through death,
of the Godlike that is in Man, and how, in the
Godlike only, has he Strength and Freedom?"
How can it be said that Carlyle did not love
humanity when we read the lines in which he
expresses reverence for the "toilworn Craftsman
that, with earth-made Implement, laboriously conquers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the Earth and makes her man's?" "Venerable
to me," he continues, "is the hard Hand;
crooked, coarse; wherein notwithstanding lies a
cunning virtue, indefeasibly royal, as of the Sceptre
of this Planet. Venerable, too, is the rugged face,
all weather-tanned, besoiled, with its rude intelligence;
for it is the face of a Man living manlike.
O, but the more venerable for thy rudeness, and
even because we must pity as well as love thee!
Hardly entreated Brother! For us was thy back
so bent, for us were thy straight limbs and fingers
so deformed; thou wert our Conscript on whom
the lot fell, and fighting our battles wert so
marred."</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the effect upon
the younger minds of his age of Carlyle's stirring
words, inciting to worthy and ever worthier effort:&mdash;"Do
the duty which lies nearest to thee, which
thou knowest to be a duty. In all situations out
of the pit of Tophet, wherein a living man has
stood, there is actually a prize of quite infinite
value placed within his reach, namely a duty for
him to do; this highest of Gospels forms the
basis and worth of all other gospels whatever."
"Brother," he says elsewhere, "thou hast possibility
in thee for much, the possibility of writing
on the eternal skies the record of a heroic life. Is
not every man, God be thanked, a potential hero?
The measure of a nation's greatness, of its worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
under the sky to God and to man, is not the
quantity of bullion it has realised, but the quantity
of heroisms it has achieved, of noble pieties and
valiant wisdoms that were in it, that still are
in it."</p>

<p>Little less valuable than "Sartor Resartus" is
"Past and Present," which was published in
1843. The reverence and delicacy with which it
touches the monasticism of a bygone age are as
remarkable as the prophetic vision with which it
deals with the social problems of our latter-day
life. State-aided emigration, co-operation and
national education, are some of the many changes
advocated here and elsewhere. Not till the
"Latter-day Pamphlets" (1850) did Carlyle become
an eloquent advocate of "force" as a guide
in politics, thereby alienating John Stuart Mill
and many of his old friends. His language
then seemed to degenerate into mere shrieking
and scolding. The world must be governed, he
declared, by men of heroic mould, who know what
is good for the inferior natures around them. Let
such inferior natures, if need be, be scourged into
silence. Parliaments he spoke of contemptuously
as "talking shops," and his sympathies went out
heartily to Governor Eyre at the time of the
Jamaica riots, and to the Southern States at the
time of the American Civil War. An admiration
for "heaven-sent heroes" had always been strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
in Carlyle, although it certainly had not its after
meaning when he wrote in early life, "Not brute
force, but only persuasion and faith are the kings
of this world." In "Heroes and Hero-worship," a
course of lectures delivered in 1840, he had waxed
eloquent over Mahomet, Luther, and Napoleon,
and three years earlier, in 1837, he had published
in his "French Revolution" a brilliant eulogy
of Mirabeau. His vindication of Cromwell was
brought about perhaps mainly by his appreciation
of the Protector's high-handed resoluteness, and
his "Life of Frederick II. of Prussia" was the
apology for a man who was the very embodiment
of despotic ideals.</p>

<p>But quite apart from Carlyle's worth as a moral
teacher or as a controversialist, his place in literature
is very high. His short biography of Schiller
was an epoch-making book, because of the influence
it has exercised upon the study of German
literature: but it bears little evidence of the genius
of its author, and, in consequence of the abundance
of Schiller correspondence subsequently
brought to light, it has been superseded by the biographies
of Palleskie and Duntzer. Carlyle's "Life
of John Sterling" is, however, a work of great power,
a kind of prose "Lycidas," which, like that great
elegy, has rescued from oblivion a man in whom
the world would soon have ceased to be interested.
Carlyle, again, was an essayist of striking individuality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Few literary sketches are more picturesque
than his "Count Cagliostro" and "The Diamond
Necklace," and the essays on Johnson and Burns
are models of generous human insight. With
literary insight, however, Carlyle was not too well
endowed, at least, when purely imaginative literature
was concerned, and he once expressed the
opinion that Shakspere had better have written in
prose. "It is part of my creed," he wrote to
Emerson, "that the only poetry is history could
we tell it right." His method of telling it gives
him a place by himself among historians, a place
so singular that it is impossible to classify him.
"Carlyle's 'French Revolution,'" said John Stuart
Mill, "is one of those productions of genius which
is above all rule, and is a law to itself." The
deathbed of Louis XV., the taking of the Bastille,
and the execution of Danton, are never-to-be-forgotten
descriptions, and the poetical passage which
follows the relation of the bloody horrors of 1789
cannot be too often quoted:&mdash;"O evening sun of
July, how, at this hour, thy beams fall slant on
reapers amid peaceful woody fields; on old women
spinning in cottages; on ships far out in the silent
main; on Balls at the Orangerie of Versailles,
where high-rouged Dames of the Palace are even
now dancing with double-jacketed Hussar-Officers;&mdash;and
also on this roaring Hell-porch of a Hôtel-de-Ville!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>The scientific history of the French Revolution
has yet to be written; and even to appreciate
Carlyle's prose epic adequately we should know
something of Mignet, Thiers, Morse Stephens, and
von Sybel, but neither the accumulation of fresh
facts, nor a philosophical deduction from such
facts, can impair the value of Carlyle's work. That,
in spite of all his fire and passion, Carlyle could
delineate character with most judicial fairness, may
be demonstrated by turning to Mr John Morley's
essays on Robespierre and the other revolutionists,
and observing how his calm and unprejudiced
intellect has pronounced judgments in every way
endorsing Carlyle's.</p>

<p>Carlyle's "Cromwell" has less attraction for us
to-day than the "French Revolution"; but the
service to historical study was even greater.
Opinions will always differ as to the wisdom of
the Protector's policy and the righteousness of his
deeds, but since the publication of these letters and
speeches, "edited with the care of an antiquarian
and the genius of a poet,"<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Cromwell's sincerity and
genuine piety have been unimpugned. There are
others beside Mr Froude who esteem the "History
of Frederick II." Carlyle's greatest work.
The humour of the book is wonderful, for Carlyle
is the greatest humorist since Sterne, and nowhere
is this humour more conspicuous than in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
"Frederick." The splendid portraits of all the
most important figures in the eighteenth century
fix themselves indelibly in the memory, and it is
even said that German soldiers study the art of
war from the descriptions of Frederick's campaigns.
Nevertheless, the book has much in it that is unsatisfying
to Englishmen. Frederick and his father
could not easily excite the hero-worshipping inclinations
of a free people, and even Carlyle became
disillusioned as he proceeded with his task, and
finally admitted that Frederick was not worth the
trouble he had given to him. He commenced it
as a "History of Frederick the Great," and concluded
it as a "History of Frederick, <i>called</i> the
Great."</p>

<p class="p2">Carlyle is surely the greatest figure in our
modern literature. He wrote no poetry worth
consideration, it is true. His verse would long
since have been forgotten had it not been for
his effectiveness as a prose writer. But although
we are accustomed to the claim for poetry that
it ranks higher than prose, it must be conceded
that in Victorian literature this is not the case,
and that Carlyle's enormous personality, his
capacity for influencing others for good and ill,
have made him the greatest moral and intellectual
force of his age. To him we owe the indifference
to mere political shibboleths, the lull in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
party warfare, which is the note of our age. He
gave no definite answer to any question, but he
gave us the impetus which led others to seek
for solutions. His literary influence on Froude
and Mill, Mr Ruskin and Mr Lecky, and numbers
of others was tremendous. The place which was
occupied by Swift in the eighteenth century is held
by Carlyle in the nineteenth, and though every
line that he has written should cease to be read,
he will still be remembered as the greatest of
literary figures in an age of great men of letters.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center b15">The Critics</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The plan of describing all the writers of a period
who are not poets, novelists and historians as
critics is open to many objections, although I
intend to adopt it. If Matthew Arnold's plea for
poetry as a criticism of life holds good, it is
precisely the poets, novelists and historians who
are the true critics. An alternative plan would
have been to give a chapter to prose writers
and another to the poets; and still another
arrangement would have been to divide the subject,
as De Quincey suggested, into the literature of
power and the literature of imagination, the former
including the philosophers and historians, the latter
the poets, the novelists, and the more picturesque
of the prose writers&mdash;Carlyle and Ruskin, for
example.</p>

<p class="p2">One unhesitatingly assigns to Mr Ruskin the
distinction of the critic whose work is most
eloquent and impressive. <b>John Ruskin</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-</b></span> was born
in Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
He has told us in his autobiography, "Præterita,"
of his early life under a tender mother's care,
of his boyish affection for Byron and Scott,
and of the youthful impulse to art study excited
by the present of Rogers's "Italy," with
Turner's illustrations. In 1837 he was entered
as a gentleman commoner at Christ Church,
Oxford, gaining, two years later, the Newdigate
prize for English poetry, his subject being "Salsette
and Elephanta." In 1843 he produced the first
volume of "Modern Painters: their Superiority in
the Art of Landscape Painting to all the Ancient
Masters. By a Graduate of Oxford." The work
originated, he says, "in indignation at the shallow
and false criticism of the periodicals of the day
on the work of the great living artist to whom it
principally refers." The artist in question was
Joseph Mallord William Turner, upon whom
Ruskin has pronounced somewhat contradictory
judgments at different periods in his career.
"Modern Painters" soon extended beyond the
mere essay at first intended, and in its final form
of five handsome volumes, it was not only a philosophical
treatise on landscape painting, but an exhaustive
dissertation on many phases of life from
one whom Mazzini declared to possess "the most
analytic brain in Europe."</p>

<p>Another important work, "The Seven Lamps of
Architecture" (1849), is a brilliant attempt at reform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
in domestic and church architecture. The
"lamps" represent the characteristics which good
architecture should possess. The first is the Lamp
of Sacrifice: "What of beauty and what of riches
we may possess, let a portion be dedicated to God.
It was in this spirit that our cathedrals were built."
The second, the Lamp of Truth, is a plea for
honesty in architecture, no imitation wood or
marble, but solid wood and solid stone. "Exactly
as a woman of feeling," he says, "would not wear
false jewels, so would a builder of honour disdain
false ornaments. The using of them is just as
downright and inexcusable a lie." The third is
the Lamp of Power: "Until that street architecture
of ours is bettered, until we give it some
size and boldness, until we give our windows recess
and our walls thickness, I know not how we can
blame our architects for their feebleness in more
important work." The fourth is the Lamp of
Beauty, and in this chapter he maintains that "all
the most lovely forms and thoughts" are directly
taken from natural objects. The fifth is the Lamp
of Life. "To those who love architecture," he
says, "the life and accent of the hand are everything."
The sixth is the Lamp of Memory: "All
public edifices should be records of national life,
all ordinary dwelling-houses endeared to their
owners by sacred and sweet associations. There
is infinite sanctity in a good man's house!" The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
seventh is the Lamp of Obedience, and here he
pleads eloquently for the enforcement of an established
type of architecture&mdash;the Gothic, in his
judgment, lending itself most readily to all services,
vulgar or noble. The "Stones of Venice" (1851-1853),
in three volumes, gives in further detail
Ruskin's views of the laws of architecture. The
pre-Raphaelite movement of Millais, Rossetti, and
Holman Hunt early enlisted his sympathy, and in
"Pre-Raphaelitism" (1851) he declared that they
had worthily followed the advice given in "Modern
Painters," to "go to nature in all singleness of
heart, and walk with her laboriously and trustingly,
having no other thought but how best to
penetrate her meaning; rejecting nothing, selecting
nothing, and scorning nothing." From that
time until his Slade lectures at Oxford in 1883-1884
Ruskin wrote several books on painting
and architecture, all of them in a style which
attracts even those who are least in sympathy
with his opinions.</p>

<p>But as Goethe declared of himself that posterity
would honour him, not for his poetry, but for his
discoveries in science, so Ruskin, perhaps more
justly, insists that it is as an economist that he is
most deserving of remembrance. The four essays
on the first principles of political economy, entitled
"Unto this Last" (1862), he declares to be "the
truest, rightest-worded, and most serviceable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
things" he has ever written. These essays were
originally published by Thackeray in the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>, but the remonstrances of its readers
brought the series to a speedy end. The principles
of state socialism there initiated have since entered
the field in direct contest with the established
order of things. Mr Ruskin would have every
child in the country taught a trade at the cost of
government; he would have manufactories and
workshops entirely under government regulation
for the production and sale of every necessary of
life, and for the exercise of every useful art; he
would permit competition with government manufactories
and shops, but all who desired work could
be sure of it at the state establishments: finally, he
would provide comfortable homes for the old and
destitute, as "it ought to be quite as natural and
straightforward a matter for a labourer to take his
pension from his parish, because he has deserved
well of his parish, as for a man in higher rank to
take his pension from his country because he has
deserved well of his country." Ruskin has
amplified his economic doctrines in "Munera
Pulveris," "Time and Tide by Wear and Tyne,"
and "Fors Clavigera." "Time and Tide" is a
collection of letters on the laws of work to the late
Thomas Dixon, a working corkcutter of Sunderland.
They were originally published in the <i>Manchester
Examiner</i>. "Fors Clavigera" is a series of ninety-six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
letters to working-men, which were issued
in monthly parts, and rendered additionally
interesting by the quantity of autobiographical
anecdotes so freely interspersed in their pages.
The title is derived, as Ruskin has explained, from
the Latin <i>fors</i>, the best part of three good English
words&mdash;force, fortitude, and fortune; the root of
the adjective <i>clavigera</i> being either <i>clava</i>, a club,
<i>clavis</i>, a key, or <i>clavus</i>, a nail, and <i>gero</i>, to carry.
Fors the Club-bearer therefore represents the
strength of Hercules or of Deed; the Key-bearer,
the strength of Ulysses or of Patience; and the
Nail-bearer, the strength of Lycurgus or of Law.</p>

<p>To carry out his principles practically, Ruskin
established for a short time a tea shop in the
Marylebone Road, where nothing but the best tea
was sold at a fair price, and he founded the St
George's Guild with a view of showing "the rational
organisation of country life independent of that of
cities;" or in other words, the restoration of the
peasantry to the soil of England. One of the
conditions of membership was that every member
should give one-tenth of his property to the guild
for carrying out its work. Ruskin led the way, his
property being then estimated at £70,000. He
has told us in "Fors" that out of the £157,000 left
him by his parents he has spent £153,000. Much
of this must have gone to the Ruskin Museum at
Sheffield.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>It is, however, in following Carlyle as a bracing,
invigorating influence that Ruskin has most claim
on the gratitude of the present generation. If
Carlyle taught us to be content with this "miserable
actual," with such environment as may have
fallen to our lot, his disciple has given the impulse
which has led to the beautifying of that environment.
The more refined taste in dress, furniture,
and in dwelling-houses which has characterized
the later Victorian era, and, side by side therewith,
a greater simplicity of life on the part of the
more cultured rich, are in an especial degree due
to the influence of Ruskin. "What is chiefly
needed in England at the present day," he says,
"is to show the quantity of pleasure that may be
obtained by a consistent, well-administered competence,
modest, confessed, and laborious. We
need examples of people who, leaving Heaven to
decide whether they are to rise in the world, decide
for themselves that they will be happy in it, and
have resolved to seek&mdash;not greater wealth, but
simpler pleasures; not higher fortune, but deeper
felicity; making the first of possessions, self-possession;
and honouring themselves in the harmless
pride and calm pursuits of peace." In the
"Crown of Wild Olive," "Time and Tide," and
"Sesame and Lilies," he emphasizes this teaching
with his customary eloquence. Of these books, by
far the most important is "Sesame and Lilies,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
which was written, he says, "while my energies
were still unbroken and my temper unfretted,
and if read in connection with 'Unto this Last,'
contains the chief truths I have endeavoured
through all my life to display, and which, under
the warnings I have received to prepare for its
close, I am chiefly thankful to have learnt and
taught." It treats of "the majesty of the influence
of good books and of good women, if we know
how to read them and how to honour." How to
read books he shows by analyzing the well-known
passage from Milton's "Lycidas" on "The Pilot
of the Galilean Lake," and explaining the deep
meaning of its every word. How to honour
women, how women may become worthy of honour,
he shows by taking us to Shakspere and
to Scott, whose Portias and Rosalinds, Catherine
Seytons and Diana Vernons are ever ready at
critical moments to be a help and a guidance to
men; and finally he appeals to the great Florentine,
and shows us Beatrice leading Dante through
the starry spheres of heaven up to the very throne
of light and of truth. But the book is full of
healthy and helpful passages, and is, like so much
that its author has written, a moral inspiration for
all who read it. "I am a great man," Ruskin once
said, with a consciousness of genius which reminds
us that Horace and Milton, Shakspere and Goethe
were equally outspoken. Posterity, we may well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
believe, will endorse the self-criticism, and will not
willingly let his works or his memory die.</p>

<p>Of late years Mr Ruskin has lived, not in the
most robust health, in a house at Coniston, in
the English Lake District.</p>

<p>The next most prominent critic of the period
is one upon whom Ruskin has always poured
his bitterest scorn, and who yet will be ever remembered
with warmest reverence by those
who are old enough to have been his contemporaries.
I mean John Stuart Mill.</p>

<p>Jeremy Bentham, who gave such an impulse to
all political reform, and made a complete revolution
in English jurisprudence, died in 1832. His
friend James Mill, who wrote the "History of
India" and an "Analysis of the Human Mind,"
died four years later. "It was," says Professor
Bain, "James Mill's greatest contribution to human
progress to have given us his son." It may be so,
and yet he seems to have done his utmost to spoil
the gift, not, as children are usually spoiled, by
over-indulgence, but by the most excessive severity.</p>

<p><b>John Stuart Mill</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1806-1873</b></span> born in Rodney Street,
Pentonville. His education, which was conducted
by his father, would have been the mental
ruin of a mind of smaller powers. "I never
was a boy," he said, "never played at cricket;
it is better to let Nature have her own way."
He began Greek at three, and Latin at eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
years of age. The list of classical authors with
whose works he was familiar at thirteen is truly
appalling. This in itself would have been a
small matter had not his cold, stern father discouraged
all imaginative reading. Poetry in particular
he was taught to look upon as mere vanity,
and there are few passages in Mill's "Autobiography"
more interesting than the story how in
early manhood Wordsworth's poetry came to him
like veritable "balm in Gilead," for spiritual
refreshment and healing. In 1823 he obtained a
clerkship in the India House, from which he withdrew,
with ample compensation, when the Indian
Government was transferred to the Crown in 1858.
Meanwhile he had been an industrious contributor
to the <i>Westminster Review</i> and other periodicals,
and regularly attended the debates of the Speculative
Society which met at Grote's house. Scarcely
any scene in literature is better known than the
destruction of the manuscript of Carlyle's "French
Revolution" which he had lent to Mill. Mill lent
it to Mrs Taylor, the lady who afterwards became
his wife, and it was inadvertently destroyed. The
speechless agony of Mill when he went to inform
his friend, the self-command with which Carlyle
and his wife concealed their own misery in endeavouring
to moderate his self-reproaches&mdash;these
and many other details have been made
familiar to us by many pens. Mill gave Carlyle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
what monetary compensation he could, and
acted, as he always acted in life, with all possible
nobleness. Mrs Taylor, who was the real culprit
on this occasion, was the wife of a wholesale
druggist in Mark Lane. When Mill made her
acquaintance, his father remonstrated, but he replied
that he had no other feelings towards
her than he would have towards an equally
able man. The equivocal friendship, which was
the talk of all Mill's circle of acquaintances, lasted
for twenty years, when Mr Taylor died, and Mill
married his widow. It is impossible to regard the
enthusiasm of Mill for this lady without feeling
how much there was in it of the humorous, how
much also of the pathetic. That Mill had a most
exaggerated opinion of her intellectual attainments
there can be no doubt. He declared her to be
the author of all that was best in his writings.
Much of his "Political Economy," he said, was
her work, and also the "Liberty" and the "Subjection
of Women." His language with regard to
her was always extravagant, and Grote said that
"only John Mill's reputation could survive such
displays." Mill's brother George declared that
she was "nothing like what John thought her," and
there is much evidence to show that she was but
a weak reflection of her husband. Still, it is impossible
not to sympathize with such an illusion.
Mrs Mill died in 1858, and was buried at Avignon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
in France, where Mill himself spent many of the
later years of his life, and where he died in 1873.
It was at Avignon that the Crown Princess of
Prussia and the Princess Alice of Hesse proposed
to visit him, when he, with due courtesy, declined
to see them.</p>

<p>Mill's works, which are very extensive, deal
with philosophical, psychological, economical, and
political problems. His "Logic" was published
in 1843, his "Essays on Unsettled Questions in
Political Economy" in 1844, his "Principles of
Political Economy" in 1848, and his "Liberty" in
1858. In 1865 he published his "Examination of
Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy." Four volumes
of "Dissertations and Discussions" appeared between
1859 and 1867, and "Considerations on
Representative Government" in 1861. In 1865
he entered Parliament as Member for Westminster,
losing his seat, however, in 1868. It
would be hard to speak too highly of Mill. As
a man he was all kindliness and considerate
thoughtfulness for others, and his ideal of life
was a very high one. Carlyle's Letters, Caroline
Fox's Memoirs, and many other sources of information,
make this clear. On the literary side
he will be variously estimated, as we survey him
from one or other aspect of his many-sided career.
As a stimulator of public opinion the work he did
was enormous. This is not the place to discuss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the value of this or that movement associated
with his name; but there can be no doubt that
many questions, like the reform of the land laws,
were initiated by him. In the seventies his philosophy
dominated Oxford. It is of no account to-day.</p>

<p>On the philosophical side Mill's position is
weakened by his ignorance of the more simple
sciences, which we now know to be of the greatest
moment in the study of intellectual problems.
Mill knew little of physics, and of biology still less.
His education in this respect belonged to the old-fashioned
type. His work in logic is all but unshaken,
although his book has been superseded for
school and college use. His psychology, however,
his ethics, much of his economics, and above all,
his metaphysics, must be corrected by later ideas.
Doubtless Mill's readjustments in mental science
are most valuable, especially his rehandling of
the old doctrines; but fundamentally these are
Hume's. Mill's chief philosophical work was destructive.
He utterly routed the remnants of a
still earlier philosophy, furbished up with all the
knowledge and all the acuteness of Sir William
Hamilton. But the great generalizations which
have changed the whole drift of our philosophy
are the Conservation of Energy, and Evolution,
including as the latter does the laws and conditions
of life, and in particular the doctrine
of Heredity. For adequate philosophical guidance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
on these subjects we must turn to Herbert
Spencer.</p>

<p>But first let me point to the number of political
economists who have followed Mill in the discussion
of the relation of society to the "wealth" it
produces. Mill's "Political Economy" was more
of a systematic summary of the prevailing doctrines
than an original work. It long formed, however,
the basis of ordinary English knowledge
on the subject, and by its adhesion to the Wages
Fund and other erroneous theories, it did not
a little harm as well as good to Economic Science.
Mill's most enthusiastic disciple in economics,
<b>Henry Fawcett</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1833-1884</b></span>, went far beyond his master in his
acceptance of the main doctrines of the Ricardo
school. Many of the positions maintained in his
"Political Economy" were abandoned by Mill
before his death, particularly the Wages Fund
theory; and in his "Autobiography" he traced
his own progress to views which, as he said,
would class him "under the general designation
of Socialist." He declared himself in favour of
"the common ownership in the raw material of
the globe, and an equal participation of all in the
benefits of combined labour."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Professor Fawcett, who published his "Manual
of Political Economy" in 1863, continued to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the last to hold to the old views, and especially
to favour as little as possible the intervention
of the State. As member of Parliament, first
for Brighton and afterwards for Hackney, he
did great service by his criticisms of Indian
finance. For more than four years (1880-1884)
he held the position of Postmaster-General,
and introduced many valuable reforms into the
department under his administration. Other
economists of importance, <b>John Elliott Cairnes</b>
and <b>William Stanley Jevons</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1824-1875</b><br /><b>1835-1882</b><br /><b>1838-</b></span>, have differed from
Mill in many theoretic principles; but the fairest
survey of the later developments of Mill's economics
is given by <b>Henry Sidgwick</b>, Knightbridge Professor
of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge, and by
Alfred Marshall (born 1842). In his "Principles
of Political Economy" (1883) Sidgwick attempts,
with great clearness, to criticise the conflicting
views of the older economists in the light of the
modern and more socialist views. He also attempts
in his "Methods of Ethics" (1874) a compromise
between the Utilitarian and the Intuitionist
schools, and he does this also in his "Elements of
Politics" (1891), a comprehensive survey of political
science. Mr Marshall, who holds the Chair
of Political Economy at Cambridge, has written
"Economics of Industry" (1879), and "Principles
of Economics" (1890). A writer who did much
to make foreign economists known in England, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
who seemed at one time destined to be the able
leader of a new school, was <b>Thomas Edward Cliffe
Leslie</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1827-1882</b></span>, whose "Essays" are full of terse and suggestive
criticism. Cliffe Leslie died, however,
without writing any work of first-rate importance.
He did something, however, following the line of
writers like Richard Jones (1790-1855), to bring
academic theory to the test of actual facts.</p>

<p>During the last twenty years of the century,
economic study has taken increasingly the direction
of elaborate investigation of the circumstances of
industrial life. On the one hand, a school of
economic historians,&mdash;Arnold Toynbee, with a
brilliant <i>aperçu</i> on "The Industrial Revolution,"
Thorold Rogers in his monumental "History of
Agriculture and Prices," Dr Cunningham, in the
"Growth of English History and Commerce," and
Professor W. J. Ashley in "Economic History and
Theory," have greatly extended our knowledge of
past industry. On the other, we have the colossal
work undertaken at his own expense by Mr Charles
Booth, assisted by a group of zealous students&mdash;including
H. Llewellyn Smith, D. F. Schloss, and
Miss Clara Collet, now all filling official posts at
the Labor Department of the Board of Trade;
and Miss Beatrice Potter (now Mrs Sidney Webb)&mdash;a
complete survey of London life, statistical,
economic, industrial, and social. The nine
volumes of this "Life and Labor of the People,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
already issued, constitute one of the most important
statistical works ever undertaken by a
private person. Mr and Mrs Sidney Webb
wrote together another valuable contribution to
economic science in "The History of Trade
Unionism" (1894).</p>

<p>But political economy is merely a branch of the
larger science of sociology, and for the first general
treatment of the whole science, since Comte, we
turn to the most characteristic philosopher of
the century. <b>Herbert Spencer</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-</b></span> was born at Derby,
where his father was a teacher of mathematics.
From his father and uncle, the latter a Congregational
minister, he received his early education.
Articled at seventeen years of age to a civil engineer,
he followed that profession with some success
for seven or eight years, when he gradually drifted
into literature&mdash;a series of letters by him "On the
Proper Sphere of Government" appearing in the
<i>Nonconformist</i> for 1842. A few years later, he
wrote for the <i>Westminster Review</i>, at the house of
the editor of which magazine he met George Eliot
in 1851, and began the most famous friendship
of his life. It was also in 1851 that he published
his first work, "Social Statics," and four
years later his "Principles of Psychology." In
1861 he published his work on "Education," and
the following year his "First Principles." Between
that time and 1896 he has slowly built up a system
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of synthetic philosophy, in a dozen bulky volumes,
which has secured him a very large following not
only in England, but throughout the Continent
and America. His "Descriptive Sociology" is
the production of many writers, who have worked
under his direction, collecting facts from travellers
and scientists all over the world.</p>

<p>To have placed Psychology and Ethics on a
scientific basis in harmony with the discoveries of
the century is a truly great achievement. Many
years have now passed away since Herbert Spencer
claimed the whole domain of knowledge as his own,
and undertook to revise, in accordance with the
latest lights, the whole sphere of philosophy.
What must have seemed intolerable presumption
in 1860 became in 1896 a completed task. In
universality of knowledge he rivals Aristotle and
Bacon at a time when the sphere of learning
is immensely larger than in their epochs. It is
not within the province of this survey of literature
to go through the twelve large volumes of his works
in detail. We would rather point out that, to the
unphilosophical reader, who would willingly know
something of Spencer's literary powers, the "Study
of Sociology," which he wrote for the "International
Scientific Series," and the treatise on "Education"
are books which all who read must enjoy.</p>

<p>To him, with Mill, belongs the glory of restoring
to Great Britain the old supremacy in philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
given to her by Bacon, continued by Locke, Hume,
and Berkeley, but temporarily interrupted by Kant
and Hegel.</p>

<p>Another writer who has attempted to combine
psychology with physiology is <b>Alexander Bain</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1818-</b></span>,
who was for many years Professor of Logic in the
University of Aberdeen, and twice Lord Rector.
Bain assisted Mill in the preparation of his
"Logic," and has himself written a treatise on that
science, also lengthy works on "The Senses and
the Intellect," and "The Emotions and the Will."
Perhaps his work on "Mental and Moral Science"
is his best-known contribution to student literature.
Although he is the author of books on grammar
and composition, Professor Bain's style is
always oppressively heavy and unattractive. As
Spencer and Bain combined psychology with
physiology, so it was the effort of Boole and De
Morgan to extend the scope of logic by an ingenious
application of mathematics.</p>

<p>The leader for many years of the "Hegelian"
school of philosophy at Oxford, which has long
held the field against Mill on the one hand and
Spencer on the other, was <b>Thomas Hill Green</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-1882</b></span>, who
was appointed Whyte Professor of Moral Philosophy
in 1877, and who published the same year a series
of articles in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, on "Mr
Herbert Spencer and Mr G. H. Lewes: their Application
of the Doctrine of Evolution to Thought."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
He was preparing for publication his "Prolegomena
to Ethics" at the time of his death, and the work
was finally edited by Professor A. C. Bradley, who
has himself written a treatise on logic, and whose
Hegelian work, entitled "Ethical Studies," is of
the highest interest. Green was a moral force in
Oxford, quite apart from his philosophical speculation,
as the following extract from one of his lectures
will indicate:&mdash;"I confess to hoping for a time
when the phrase, 'the education of a gentleman,'
will have lost its meaning, because the sort of education
which alone makes the gentleman in any true
sense will be within the reach of all. As it was
the aspiration of Moses that all the Lord's people
should be prophets, so with all seriousness and
reverence we may hope and pray for a condition
of English society in which all honest citizens will
recognize themselves and be recognized by each
other as gentlemen."</p>

<p><b>George Henry Lewes</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1817-1878</b></span>, whose name is frequently
joined with that of Spencer by his association of
biology with ethics and psychology, was the son of
Charles Lee Lewes, the actor, and was one of the
most versatile writers of our times. His first
important work was the "Biographical History of
Philosophy," originally published in 1845 in
Knight's Shilling Library, but amplified without
improvement into two substantial volumes in
1867. Lewes's distaste for the ordinary metaphysics,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
and the severity of his criticism on
Hegel, have rendered this work the <i>bête noir</i> of
all transcendental students; but it remains the one
English "History of Philosophy" of any pretension.
More unqualified praise may be given to
the "Life of Goethe," which Lewes published in
1855. Perhaps no other man then living could
have shown himself competent to deal with
Goethe's many-sidedness&mdash;to discuss "Faust"
and "Tasso," "Hermann und Dorothea" at one
moment, the poet's biological and botanical discoveries
the next, and to estimate at their true
worth the speculations on colours, which Goethe
held to be more calculated than his poems to
secure him immortality. The book remains the
standard life of the great Weimar sage in this
country, and is popular in Germany, in spite of a vast
Goethe literature which has been published since
its appearance. In addition to these great works
Lewes wrote two novels, one of which, "Ranthorpe,"
Charlotte Brontë praised enthusiastically.
He edited the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, and also initiated
a craze for aquaria, by his "Seaside Studies;"
he endeavoured, indeed, to popularise many of the
sciences, particularly physiology. His last years
were devoted to philosophical questions, and his
"Problems of Life and Mind" were published in
fragments, the concluding volume, under George
Eliot's editorship, after his death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest writer of the era to popularise
science was <b>Sir David Brewster</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1781-1868</b></span>, an eminent
physicist, in whose <i>Edinburgh Cyclopædia</i> Carlyle
commenced his literary career. His "Life of
Newton," "Martyrs of Science," and "More
Worlds than One" are still widely read. <b>Michael
Faraday</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1791-1867</b></span>, another famous physicist, is still better
remembered by our own generation, principally
for his popular lectures at the Royal Institution,
where he was superintendent of the laboratory for
forty-eight years. He was a blacksmith's son, and
was originally apprenticed to a bookbinder. After
his discovery of magneto-electricity, he had, he
told Tyndall, a hard struggle to decide whether he
should make wealth or science the pursuit of his
life. Tyndall calculates that Faraday could easily
have realised £150,000; but he declared for
science and died a poor man.</p>

<p><b>John Tyndall</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-1893</b></span>, who once said that it was his great
ambition to play the part of Schiller to this Goethe,
succeeded Faraday at the Royal Institution, and
wrote about him eloquently in his "Faraday as a
Discoverer." Tyndall was born at Leighlin
Bridge, Carlow, Ireland, in 1820. His father was
a member of the Irish constabulary. His services
to many branches of science were great; but he
concerns us here not so much by his treatises on
electricity, sound, light, and heat, or by his discoveries
in diamagnetism, as by his "Lectures on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Science for Unscientific People," which, Huxley
said, was the most scientific book he had ever
read, and which has yet the transcendent merit of
giving enjoyment as well as instruction, even to the
readers of three-volume novels. In 1856 Tyndall
made a journey to Switzerland, in company with
Professor Huxley, and the friends afterwards wrote
a treatise "On the Structure and Motion of
Glaciers." Geological treatises may be said to
have given the fullest play to the literary side
of science. The work of Robert Bentley and
Sir Joseph Hooker in botany, of Michael Foster,
St George Mivart, and Francis Maitland Balfour in
biology, is, it may be, equal or superior to that
of the bulk of the writers whose achievements
we have chronicled; but it is not a part of
literature. Burdon Sanderson, Balfour Stewart,
and a host of other men, have done incalculable
service in the Victorian era&mdash;service, it is to
be feared, which scarcely obtains as generous recognition
as the cheap generalisations of smaller
men; but scientific text-books, however important,
are scarcely within the scope of these chapters.
Geology, on the other hand, is, as it were, a conglomerate
of the sciences, and lends itself readily
to the most eloquent literary expression. Few
writers have been more widely read than <b>Hugh
Miller</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1802-1856</b></span>, a Cromarty stone-mason, whose first
enthusiasm for study of the rocks arose from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
following his trade, but whose life was mainly
devoted to journalism, and to editing <i>The Witness</i>.
His "Old Red Sandstone," "Footprints of the
Creator," and "The Testimony of the Rocks"
were effective in kindling a taste for natural
science.</p>

<p>The special study which Miller gave to the Red
Sandstone rocks was extended by <b>Sir Roderick
Impey Murchison</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1792-1871</b></span> to the Silurian System, and his
work entitled "Siluria" has passed through many
editions. Scotland seems to have been the nursery
of geologists, for Miller and Murchison, Lyell
and the brothers Geikie, were all born north of
the Tweed. <b>Sir Charles Lyell</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1797-1875</b></span> was born at Kinnordy,
in Forfarshire, and educated at Midhurst,
and at Exeter College, Oxford. Called to the bar,
he went the Western Circuit for two years, but,
when attending some of Dr Buckland's lectures,
he became attached to geology. His "Principles
of Geology," first published in 1830, caused a
revolution in the science. Never before had
there been presented such a connected illustration
of the influences which had caused the earth's
changes in the unresting distribution of land
and water areas. Much of Lyell's great work
reads like a fairy tale; much might have been
thought the fruit of an imaginative rather than of
a scientific mind. Lyell's smaller book, the
"Student's Elements of Geology," was injured in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
literary merit by the progressive study of the
science of which he had been the second father.
The constant addition of fresh knowledge, and his
conversion to Darwin's views, necessitated the continual
rewriting of parts and further revision by
other hands after the author's death. "The
Antiquity of Man" (in defence of Darwin's theory)
is of more value from a literary standpoint. Before
the beginning of the reign <b>William Buckland</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1784-1856</b></span>, Dean
of Westminster, by whose lectures Lyell had so
much profited, had written his famous Bridgewater
Treatise on "Geology and Mineralogy considered
with reference to Natural Theology." His son,
<b>Frank Buckland</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1826-1880</b></span>, wrote clever and readable books
on "Natural History," and had genuine enthusiasm
for the study of animal life; but he was charged
with having vulgarised the studies in which he
took so keen an interest. The most distinguished
living geologist is Sir Archibald Geikie, who is
now director-general of the Geological Survey of
the United Kingdom. His "Text Book," which
was first published in 1882, is a model of lucid
writing, and his essays are among the most pleasant
literary products of the age. His brother, James
Geikie, has written an important work on glaciation,
entitled "The Great Ice Age."</p>

<p>But the scientific literature of the past sixty years
might almost be said to be summarised in the work
of <b>Charles Darwin</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1882</b></span>. A funeral in Westminster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Abbey, amid the mourning of many nations, closed
the career of one whose life-work had often been
greeted with scorn. "Our century is Darwin's
century," said a leading German newspaper (<i>Allgemeine
Zeitung</i>) at his death, and the statement is
no exaggeration. Those who witnessed the long
stream of prelates and nobles who filed through
the Abbey at his funeral, the then Archbishop of
Canterbury (Dr Tait) and the present Prime
Minister (Lord Salisbury) among the number,
could not but recall the reception of the great
investigator's theory twenty years before. Bishop
Wilberforce in particular denounced it in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> as "a flimsy speculation."
Darwin's antecedents were of a nature such as,
on the principle of heredity, a great man should
possess. His paternal grandfather, Erasmus Darwin,
was a poet, whose "Botanic Garden" may
still be read with interest. His maternal grandfather
was Josiah Wedgwood, the famous potter.
Darwin was the son of a doctor of Shrewsbury, and
was educated at the Grammar School of that city
and at Christ's College, Cambridge. Here his
natural history studies were sympathetically directed
by Professor Henslow, the botanist, by whose recommendation
he was selected to accompany the
<i>Beagle</i> on its expedition to survey the South American
coast. The results of his travels were embodied
in his first important work, "Journals of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Researches during a Voyage round the World,"
which was published in 1839, and was republished
under the title of "A Naturalist's Voyage round
the World." In the same year he married his
cousin, Miss Wedgwood, and, after a few years of
London life, took up his residence in a pleasant
country house at Down, near Beckenham, in Kent.
Here he pursued his remarkable investigations
until his death, surrounded by his accomplished
children, and finding, as he told a friend, his
highest emotional gratification in the joys of family
life and a love of animate nature. Two of his
sons, George Howard Darwin and Francis Darwin,
have done good work in science, the one in geology
and astronomy, the other in botany. Darwin himself
wrote also on the "Structure and Distribution
of Coral Reefs," revolutionising the popular
view concerning these remarkable phenomena.
Discovering that reef-building polyps cannot live
at depths of more than twenty fathoms, he found
it necessary to explain the presence of rocks
built by them which rise from more than 2000 feet
below the surface of the sea. This he did on the
hypothesis of a gradual subsidence of the sea-floor
whilst the polyps are at work. This view has since
been generally accepted by geologists, although
somewhat modified by Dr John Murray's observation
in the <i>Challenger</i> expedition, that the reefs
are not always of solid coral, and that they may in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
many cases have been formed on the cones of
extinct volcanoes.</p>

<p>Darwin had pondered for many years over the
theory which was to make him famous before he
decided to bring his conclusions before the public.
After considerable observation of every form of
animal and vegetable life and experiments in
selective breeding he concluded that the species
of plants and animals now on the earth were
not created in their present form, but had been
evolved by unbroken descent with modification
of structure from cruder forms, the remains of
many of which are constantly discovered in
the older rocks. He discovered in 1858 that
<b>Alfred Russel Wallace</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1822-</b></span> had independently
arrived at the same conclusions, and so it
was agreed that their views should be jointly laid
before the Linnæan Society. In 1859 the "Origin
of Species" was published, and it was followed by
a number of works bearing upon the same subject,
the most notable of all being the "Descent of
Man." Darwin's work on "Earth Worms," perhaps
the most purely literary of all his writings, appeared
the year before his death. It is not the province
of a sketch of Victorian literature to discuss the
many important bearings of the Darwinian hypothesis.
Received with unbounded contempt by
literary men so eminent as Carlyle and Ruskin, it
was accepted only with qualification by men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
science like Agassiz, Carpenter, and Owen; but an
overwhelming majority of scientific men in England,
America, and above all in Continental countries,
have declared in its favour. The theory has received
popular interpretation in Germany from
Haeckel, and in England from Huxley, although
in this connection we must not forget <b>George John
Romanes</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1848-1894</b></span>, the author of "Animal Intelligence" and
"Mental Evolution in Animals," Grant Allen, and
Edward Clodd.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Henry Huxley</b> (<b>1825-1895</b>), one of the greatest of
our men of science, was of interest not only on
account of his vast scientific attainments, but for
his profound acquaintance with metaphysics, as
illustrated in his "Life of Hume," his wide
culture, and his exquisite literary style. He was
born and educated at Ealing, in Middlesex, where
his father was a schoolmaster. He studied medicine
at the Charing Cross Hospital, then entered
the Royal Navy as an assistant surgeon, and went
in the <i>Rattlesnake</i> to survey the Barrier Reef of
Australia. The papers which he sent to the Royal
and Linnæan Societies gave him fame. After his
return he devoted himself to original research; but
work of that sort brings no recompense in money,
and Huxley's means were narrow. In 1854, however,
he obtained the chairs of Natural History
and Palæontology at the School of Mines, and
to this he afterwards added the appointment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Inspector of Fisheries. The "blue ribbon" of
science, the Presidency of the Royal Society, was
conferred on him in 1883. Huxley wrote much
on biological problems, and by the publication
of his "Physiography" gave a new name to the
science which has extended the scope of the old
Physical Geography: but his chief interest for us
here is in his "Lay Sermons," "Addresses and
Reviews," his "Critiques and Addresses," and
his "American Addresses," all of which may
take rank among the finest prose of our age.</p>

<p class="p2">As an interesting contrast to the work of Darwin
and Huxley, and all that it has implied to modern
literature, one may refer once again to the movement
inspired by Cardinal Newman. His most
prominent associates for many years, neither of
whom, however, left the Church of England for
the Church of Rome, were Pusey and Keble.</p>

<p><b>Edward Bouverie Pusey</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1800-1882</b></span> was practically the
founder of the modern High Church movement
in the Anglican community. A writer of "Tracts
for the Times," he was, after Newman had "gone
over to Rome," the recognized head of the movement,
and his followers were frequently called
"Puseyites." A demoralization of the party
seemed inevitable on Newman's secession, but
the publication of Dr Pusey's "Letter to Keble"
gave it fresh life. In 1866 his "Eirenicon," a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
proposal for the reunion of Christendom, drew
a reply from Cardinal Newman, with whom, however,
he maintained the profoundest friendship to
the end. <b>John Keble</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1792-1866</b></span>, who was born at Fairford,
in Gloucestershire, was a man of far higher gifts.
Educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he
obtained a fellowship at Oriel. For some years
he was Professor of Poetry at Oxford, a position
for which he had qualified himself by the publication
of the "Christian Year," a volume of
religious poems for every Sunday and church
festival, many of which have been admitted into
the hymnology of all the Christian sects. Perhaps
truer poetry is to be found in his "Lyra Innocentium,"
a series of poems on children, for there
the human element is more marked. Keble also
wrote a "Life of Bishop Wilson," and published
several volumes of sermons.</p>

<p class="p2">The movement of Liberal theology, to which
men like Keble gave the name of "national
apostasy," was headed in its earlier developments
by Archbishop Whately and Dr Arnold of Rugby,
and more recently by the Rev. Frederick Denison
Maurice and Dean Stanley. <b>Richard Whately</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1787-1863</b></span>,
who was at Oriel with Keble, had published his
once popular "Logic" and "Rhetoric" before
the commencement of the reign of Victoria, and
in 1831 had been made Archbishop of Dublin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
a position which he held till his death, in 1863,
winning all hearts by his kindness and liberality,
by his generous tolerance and zeal for progress.
His "Logic" is chiefly of importance for the
impetus it gave to the study of that science.
His "Christian Evidences" gained in its day a
wider audience. <b>Thomas Arnold</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1795-1842</b></span> was born at
East Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, and was educated
at Winchester, and with Keble at Corpus
Christi College, Oxford. After ordination he removed
to Laleham-on-Thames, where he prepared
young men for the universities. When, in 1827,
the head-mastership of Rugby became vacant,
Arnold was elected on the strength of a recommendation
by Dr Hawkins, to the effect that he
"would change the face of education all through
the public schools of England." The prophecy
was fulfilled. He was the first to introduce
modern languages and modern history and mathematics
into the regular school course. At the
same time he always insisted on the value of the
classics as a basis of education, and himself prepared
an edition of "Thucydides," and wrote a
"History of Rome" in its earlier periods, which is
at least eminently interesting. His services to his
country as an educational reformer were even
greater on the moral side. Dr Arnold was a
purifying influence to men of the higher classes,
to a degree which is inexplicable to the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
generation. For a time he was unpopular, and his
school suffered, through his advocacy of church reform
and his association with political Liberalism;
but the success of his pupils at the universities had
caused a reaction in his favour at the time of his
death, which occurred all too early, for he was
only forty-seven. Of his many distinguished
pupils, perhaps the best known are Tom Hughes
and Dean Stanley. <b>Thomas Hughes</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1823-1896</b></span>, who in 1882
was made a county-court judge, wrote many books,
but only one of them entitles him to be remembered
to-day. In a moment of happy inspiration,
he wrote the finest boy's book in the language.
"Tom Brown's School Days" was published in
1857. It is a picture of life at Rugby, under
Dr Arnold's healthy, manly guidance.</p>

<p><b>Arthur Penrhyn Stanley</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1815-1881</b></span> wrote his "Life of
Dr Arnold" in 1844. A son of Edward Stanley,
Bishop of Norwich, he was born at Alderley, in
Cheshire. From Rugby he went to Balliol College,
Oxford, where he had an exceptionally distinguished
career. In 1851 he became a canon of
Canterbury, and his picturesque "Memorials of
Canterbury" were the outcome of residence in
that city. In 1863 he was made Dean of Westminster,
notwithstanding the opposition of the
High Church party, to whom the theological views
expressed in his numerous works were distasteful.
Of these writings, "Sinai and Palestine," "Lectures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
on the Eastern Church," and "Lectures on
the Jewish Church," are the best known. As Dean
of Westminster Dr Stanley became an active leader
of the Broad Church movement. Although not a
contributor to "Essays and Reviews" his services
to the movement were incalculable. He invited
Max Müller to lecture in the Abbey, befriended
Père Hyacinthe, and gave sympathy to Bishop
Colenso. His speeches in the Lower House of
Convocation, particularly one in which he proposed
the suppression of the Athanasian Creed
in the services of the Church, made him many
enemies; but few ecclesiastics have been so beloved
by both sovereign and people. One recalls the
pleasant, active little man, so proud of his Abbey
Church, with a deep sigh that he should be no
more. His life was written by his successor, Dean
Bradley.</p>

<p>Of the contributors to "Essays and Reviews,"
the manifesto of the Broad Church party, which
appeared in 1860, Frederick Temple must be
mentioned, because his contribution, "The Education
of the World," led to a frantic effort to prevent
his receiving the bishopric of Exeter, an effort
which was unsuccessful. In 1885 Dr Temple was
made Bishop of London, and in 1896 Archbishop
of Canterbury. Other distinguished writers in
"Essays and Reviews" were Dr Jowett and Mr
Mark Pattison. <b>Benjamin Jowett</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1817-1893</b></span>, master of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Balliol, who wrote the essay on "The Interpretation
of Scripture," achieved his greatest successes
by his brilliant translations of Plato, Thucydides,
and "The Politics" of Aristotle. His Plato
drew from John Bright, who was little inclined to
appreciate the great thoughts of the Athenian
philosopher, an expression of admiration for the
classic English of the Oxford professor. Jowett's
life was written by Evelyn Abbott and Lewis
Campbell. <b>Mark Pattison</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1813-1884</b></span>, whose contribution
to "Essays and Reviews" was on "The Tendencies
of Religious Thought in England," assisted
Newman and Pusey in the early days of the Tractarian
movement, but finally went over to the
Liberalism which they so much dreaded. In 1861
he was elected Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford.
Pattison was a profound scholar. Few men have
led lives so absorbed in books. The results of his
learning are apparent in his interesting "Life of
Isaac Casaubon," which he had hoped to follow
by a life of Scaliger.</p>

<p>But men like Jowett and Pattison have been the
arm-chair representatives of a movement which
found one of its most active supporters in <b>John
Frederick Denison Maurice</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1805-1872</b></span>. Maurice was the son
of a Unitarian minister, and was born at Normanstone,
near Lowestoft. For a time he was editor
of the <i>Athenæum</i>, but joined the Anglican
Church in 1831, and accepted a curacy near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Leamington. A treatise entitled "Subscription
no Bondage," which defined his position in the
Church, excited much attention, as did also his
tracts on the "Kingdom of Christ." In conjunction
with Kingsley and Hughes he published pamphlets
called "Politics for the People," and organised
the Christian socialist and co-operative movement
of 1850. Like Kingsley, Maurice may be
labelled a Broad Churchman, not so much on
doctrinal grounds as for the breadth of his
sympathies. It was social rather than theological
problems to which he attached importance.
Kingsley, indeed, described himself to correspondents
as a Broad Churchman, a High Churchman,
and an Evangelical, as the mood seemed to take
him. Bishop Colenso is a good type of the more
militant theologians. <b>John William Colenso</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1814-1883</b></span> first
came before the public as the author of mathematical
text-books. At this time he was vicar of Forncett
St Mary, in Norfolk, but in 1853 he was made
Bishop of Natal. In South Africa he was a zealous
advocate of the rights of the natives against the
oppression of the Boers and Cape Town officials;
but in a measure his influence was weakened by
the publication of his work on Biblical criticism,
"The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua Critically
Examined," which was condemned by both Houses
of Convocation as heretical. When Colenso came
to England in 1874 he was inhibited from preaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
in the dioceses of London, Lincoln, and
Oxford. At Oxford, however, his sermon was read
from the pulpit of Balliol while the Bishop sat
below, and the same device was pursued at Mr
Stopford Brooke's Church in London. Dean
Stanley invited him to the Abbey pulpit, claiming
freedom from the jurisdiction of Dr Jackson, the
then Bishop of London; but Colenso declined to
increase the ill-feeling which had been excited.</p>

<p>Another distinguished member of the Broad
Church party, <b>Edwin Abbott</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-</b></span>, was head-master of
the City of London School from 1865 to 1889.
He has published several educational works. His
religious influence has developed itself through
"Philochristus; Memoirs of a Disciple of our
Lord," and "Onesimus; Memoirs of a Disciple
of St Paul," also by a volume of sermons,
"Through Nature to Christ," which is perhaps
the best evidence of the development of the
Broad Church movement. Dr Whately, one of
its founders, argued for the miracles as indicative
of the Divine origin of Christianity; Dr Abbott
esteems the insistence on miracles as a bar to
belief. Perhaps the purest and most inspiring of
all the eloquent teachers belonging to this party
was <b>Frederick William Robertson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1816-1853</b></span> of Brighton,
whose sermons have been widely read, especially
in America, and whose lectures are as helpful and
bracing as any written in our time. Robertson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
remarkable career of only thirty-seven years has
been made known to us by the beautiful life which
was written by Mr Stopford Brooke. <b>Stopford
Augustus Brooke</b> (<b>1832-</b> ) was born in Dublin and educated
at Trinity College. At first he was a Church of
England clergyman and a Queen's Chaplain, but
seceded in 1880 on account of his inability to
believe in many supernatural phases of Christian
teaching. His "Primer of English Literature,"
"History of Early English Poetry," "Theology in
the English Poets," and "Life of Milton" have the
ring of the genuine, and, indeed, of the great, critic.</p>

<p>Outside the pale of the Anglican community,
but powerful factors in that same Broad Church
movement which has been charged with "stretching
the old formula to meet the new facts," one
recalls the names of Lynch and Martineau.
<b>Thomas Toke Lynch</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1818-1871</b></span> was born at Dunmow, in
Essex, and held for many years the ministry of
a small Congregational Church, first in Grafton
Street and afterwards in the Hampstead Road,
London. He died in comparative obscurity;
but the poems in his "Rivulet," once condemned
as heretical, have found their way into
most hymnologies.</p>

<p><b>James Martineau</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1805-</b></span> was born at Norwich, and
was originally educated for the profession of civil
engineer, but turned to theological studies, and
was for some time the minister of a Presbyterian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Church in Dublin. Then, during a residence in
Liverpool, he became a supporter of the philosophy
of Bentham and the elder Mill, but finally abandoned
that position for Kantian metaphysics.
Thenceforth he was to be a great power on behalf
of the Theistic and Unitarian position, and he
turned vigorously upon the materialistic beliefs
which he had abandoned, and was, it may be
added, somewhat too harsh to his sister Harriet
when, later in life, she adopted them. His "Endeavour
after the Christian Life" and "Hours
of Thought on Sacred Things" are two of his
best known works, although a more philosophical
interest attaches to his "Study of Spinoza" and
his "Types of Ethical Theory."</p>

<p>I have dwelt at some length on the work of the
High Church and Broad Church parties during the
reign, because with these bodies it has been a
period of great literary achievement, and it can
scarcely be claimed that Evangelicanism, however
earnest, zealous, and numerically powerful, has
added much of enduring worth to religious literature.
<b>Richard William Church</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1815-1890</b></span>, Dean of St Paul's,
who wrote so eloquently on Dante and St Anselm,
belonged to the Liberal High Church school, as
did also <b>Henry Parry Liddon</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1829-1890</b></span>, a canon of the same
cathedral, whose Bampton lectures "On the Divinity
of Jesus Christ" marked him out as one of the
most eloquent of modern preachers. One of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
greatest scholars in the English Church, <b>Joseph
Barber Lightfoot</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828-1889</b></span>, Bishop of Durham, who replied
to the author of "Supernatural Religion," belonged
to the same party. Midway between the Broad
Church and the Evangelical schools we find
<b>Frederick William Farrar</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1831-</b></span>, Dean of Canterbury,
who, as head-master of Marlborough College,
wrote stories of boy life. He succeeded
Kingsley as a Canon of Westminster, and excited
much attention by his sermons on the doctrine
of eternal punishment. His lives of Christ
and of St Paul have been widely read. <b>John
Charles Ryle</b> (<b>1816-</b> ), Bishop of Liverpool, has been
perhaps the most famous literary exponent of
the Evangelical position. "Shall we know one
another in Heaven" and "Bible Inspiration" were
characteristic books from his pen. <b>John Saul
Howson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1816-1885</b></span>, Dean of Chester, who, in conjunction
with the Rev. W. J. Conybeare, wrote an able
work on "The Life and Epistles of St Paul,"
was also a Low Churchman.</p>

<p>The most distinguished Nonconformist minister
of the Victorian period, and the man whose sermons
found most readers, was <b>Charles Haddon
Spurgeon</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1834-1892</b></span>, with whom eloquence and earnestness
were combined with the possession of a simple
English style, which he derived from a study
of the Puritan fathers. In "John Ploughman's
Talk" (1868) Spurgeon put forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
much homely wisdom in a quaint and humorous
garb.</p>

<p class="p2">I have said well nigh enough concerning
speculative writers and theologians, but it is
necessary to mention here <b>Henry Longueville
Mansel</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1820-1871</b></span>, who succeeded Milman as Dean of St
Paul's. Mansel was a vigorous defender of the
Anglican position. "The Limits of Religious
Thought" was the title of one of his books;
"Metaphysics, or the Philosophy of Consciousness,
Phenomenal and Real" was another, but he
crossed swords with many disputants, with F. D.
Maurice, with J. S. Mill, and indeed he was ever
a fighter, subtle and skilful. Another theologian,
<b>Cardinal Manning</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1808-1892</b></span>, was a disputant on behalf of
Roman Catholicism, he having left the Anglican
Church in 1851. His many books and sermons
are to-day only of interest to the theological
student. His life was written in 1896, and caused
much controversy through its exceeding candour
and indiscretion.</p>

<p class="p2">Philosophy has had notable students also in
Ferrier, Caird, and Clifford. <b>James Frederick
Ferrier</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1808-1864</b></span> who was a nephew of Susan Ferrier the
author of "Marriage," was professor of moral
philosophy at St Andrews. He wrote "Lectures
in Greek Philosophy" and other works. <b>Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Caird</b> (<b>1835-</b> ) is master of Balliol and he has written
"Philosophy of Kant," "Essays on Literature
and Philosophy," and "The Evolution of
Religion." <b>William Kingdon Clifford</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1845-1879</b></span> belonged
to the opposite camp. He obtained an early
reputation as a mathematician and became
professor of applied mathematics in University
College, London, in 1871. His powerful contributions
to the literary side of science were
contained in "Seeing and Thinking" and
"Lectures and Essays," the latter volume being
edited after his death by his friends Mr Leslie
Stephen and Sir Frederick Pollock.</p>

<p class="p2">The three most notable books that we have
seen from the anti-theological side, apart from
Matthew Arnold's "Literature and Dogma," are
"The Creed of Christendom," "Phases of Faith,"
and "Supernatural Religion," although to these
may perhaps be added translations of the Lives of
Christ, of Strauss, and of Renan. The "Creed of
Christendom" was the work of <b>William Rathbone
Greg</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1881</b></span>, who wrote also "Enigmas of Life" (1872),
and "Rocks Ahead" (1874). "Phases of Faith"
was the work of <b>Francis William Newman</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1805-1897</b></span>, a
younger brother of Cardinal Newman, but at the
opposite pole of religious conviction. He has
written many books, the most successful being one
on "The Soul" (1849). Another on "Theism"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
(1858), was inspired by the same theistic, but
non-Christian impulse. "Phases of Faith" (1858),
was his most successful work. The author of
"Supernatural Religion" is Walter Richard
Cassels, who has also published a reply to
Bishop Lightfoot's strictures upon his larger
work&mdash;a work now all but forgotten, but which
created a considerable sensation at the time of its
appearance.</p>

<p>The age has been, particularly in its later developments,
an age of good critics of literature.
Criticism unhappily rarely lasts much beyond its
own decade. Even Mr Matthew Arnold lives
now only by his poetry, and the many good
things that he said about books are being steadily
forgotten. Arnold was a great critic, and so also
was <b>Walter Pater</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1839-1894</b></span>, whose "Marius the Epicurean"
and "Imaginary Portraits" should have ranked
him with writers of imagination were it not that
criticism was his dominant faculty. Pater has
been described as "the most rhythmical of
English prose writers," and his "Renaissance:
Studies in Art and Poetry," and his "Appreciations"
give him a very high place among the
writers of our time.</p>

<p><b>Philip Gilbert Hamerton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1834-1894</b></span> was another great
critic, who wrote at least one work of imagination.
"Marmorne" is a very pretty story of life in
France. With every aspect of French life Mr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Hamerton was well acquainted, as he lived in
that country for very many years. He wrote regularly
upon art topics, and edited an art magazine,
<i>The Portfolio</i>; but it is by his volume of essays
entitled "The Intellectual Life" that he will be
most kindly remembered for many a year to come.</p>

<p class="p2">Certain writers whom I must mention are entitled
to a place both as critics and as poets.
Mr W. E. Henley, Mr F. W. H. Myers,
William Bell Scott, and William Allingham for
example. <b>William Ernest Henley</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1849- </b></span> has written
plays in conjunction with R. L. Stevenson, and
his "Book of Verses" and "Song of the Sword"
entitle him to very high rank among the poets
of the day. But he is also a critic of exceptional
vigour and force, and since Matthew Arnold there
has been no volume of criticism so full of discrimination
and sound judgment as "Views and
Reviews." Ill health has compelled Mr Henley
to waste much of his undoubted talent. He is
at present editing fine library editions of Burns
and Byron. <b>Frederic William Henry Myers</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1843- </b></span>
wrote "Saint Paul," a poem of considerable
reputation, but his critical essays are more widely
known. They were published in two volumes,
"Classical" and "Modern," and are full of delightful
ideas delightfully expressed. His biography of
Wordsworth is a daintily fanciful memoir, abounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
in good criticism. Mr Myers's brother Ernest
is also a poet, and so also was <b>William Bell Scott</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1811-1890</b></span>.
He was, it is true, a poet of a narrow range,
but a critic of great energy and industry. Bell
Scott became best known by his "Autobiography,"
published after his death. In it he discussed
Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelite movement with
sufficient frankness. <b>William Allingham</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1824-1889</b></span> wrote
many poems and ballads full of the Celtic spirit,
and of Ireland, which he loved as the land of his
birth. Allingham was for a time editor of <i>Fraser's
Magazine</i>, and he contributed regularly to the chief
literary periodicals of his day.</p>

<p class="p2">Literary critics of importance to-day are Edward
Dowden, Richard Garnett, George Saintsbury,
Edmund Gosse, Leslie Stephen, and Andrew Lang&mdash;all
of whom are happily living and writing.</p>

<p><b>Edward Dowden</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1843-</b></span>, who is an Irishman, and a
professor of Trinity College, Dublin, has a genius
for accuracy and is a master of detail. For textual
criticism of Wordsworth and Shelley he has no
superior. He has an immense knowledge of the
literature of many languages, and holds without
dispute the first place among living students of
German literature in this country. His knowledge
of English literature is profound, and in "Shakspere,
his Mind and Art," and "Studies in Literature,"
he has said some singularly illuminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
things about books. With his "Life of Shelley"
one observes a certain deterioration; Professor
Dowden, with all his profound love of literature,
has scarcely the qualities which would find attraction
in the curiously impulsive character of the
poet Shelley. Dowden was happier when writing
about Southey, and he is still more at home with
great impersonal literary figures like Shakspere
and Goethe.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Richard Garnett</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1835-</b></span>,&mdash;better known to the world
to-day as Dr Garnett&mdash;has also written on Shelley,
not merely with sympathy but with partisanship.
Dr Garnett, who is honourably associated with
the British Museum Library, is a most acute critic,
a biographer of Carlyle and Emerson, a translator
from the Greek and German, and, like Professor
Dowden, a poet.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>George Saintsbury</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1845-</b></span>, who is Professor of English
Literature at the University of Edinburgh, has been
an industrious critic for many years, and his knowledge
of French literature in particular is profound.
His acquaintance with English literature in the
seventeenth century has, however, considerably
vitiated his style. It is not easy to tolerate the
phraseology of the seventeenth century in modern
books. This defect of style is regrettably noticeable
in two volumes of literary history which Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Saintsbury has published, one dealing with
the seventeenth and the other with the nineteenth
century. It is in certain brief biographies of Sir
Walter Scott and others that Professor Saintsbury
is most excellent; but his wide knowledge and his
genuine grasp of the most salient characteristics of
good literature are indisputable qualities which
rank him high among the bookmen of his day.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Edmund Gosse</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1849-</b></span> is not less distinguished than the
writers I have named. He would be widely
known as a writer of charming verse were he not
actively engaged in literary criticism. The son of
a famous naturalist, Mr Gosse is the author of
many admirably written books about the literature
of the past and the present. What Carlyle so
largely did for German literature by introducing
it to English readers Mr Gosse has done for
Scandinavian literature. In conjunction with Mr
William Archer&mdash;a dramatic critic of singular
insight&mdash;he has translated Ibsen, whose influence
has been as marked during the past ten years as
the influence of German writers was marked during
the previous thirty. Mr Gosse's best biography
is his "Life of Gray."</p>

<p class="p2">A critic of remarkable learning is <b>Leslie Stephen</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1832-</b></span>,
whose "Hours in a Library" and "History of
English Thought in the Eighteenth Century" are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
books which have profoundly impressed the age.
Mr Leslie Stephen has written a large number of
biographies, all of them characterised by singular
accuracy, by remarkable graces of style, and by
genuine insight. He was the first editor of the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, a work which
has proved invaluable to students of our later
literature.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Andrew Lang</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1844-</b></span> is the last of the critics I have
named, and not the least active. He has shone in
many branches of literary work. His "Ballads
and Lyrics of Old France," "Ballades in Blue
China," and numerous other verses, have gained
him considerable reputation as a poet. His translations
of Homer and Theocritus are by many
counted the finest translations that our literature
has seen. Some have contended that his musical
prose rendering of the Odyssey is incomparably
superior to all the efforts of Pope, of Cowper, and
of the many other poets who have attempted to
render Homer in verse. Mr Lang is an authority
on folk-lore; he has joined issue with Professor
Max Müller on many points which are of keen
interest to those who are attracted towards the
science of language and the study of comparative
religion. As a writer of fairy-tales,
and as the editor of books of fairy-stories,
Mr Lang has endeared himself to thousands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
belonging to the younger generation. But all this
is but dimly and inefficiently to appraise Mr Lang's
marvellous versatility. He has written fiction,
history, and, above all, biography, his biographical
work including a Life of Sir Stafford Northcote
and a Life of John Gibson Lockhart, Scott's
son-in-law.</p>

<p class="p2">Biography has generally been written by literary
critics, and one requires no apology in any
case for ranking the biographers among the
critics. <b>John Gibson Lockhart</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1794-1854</b></span> himself was a
notable example. He was editor of the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, and an industrious writer for many years;
but he is best known to us by his "Life of Sir
Walter Scott," which was published&mdash;it is worthy
of note&mdash;in 1837, the year of the Queen's accession.
Lockhart's "Scott" is beyond question the
most important biography of the reign. The
longest is that of Milton by Professor Masson.
<b>David Masson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1822-</b></span> has held a chair of literature in
University College, London, and later at Edinburgh.
Few men know English literature better
than he. His name will always be associated with
his monumental "Life of Milton," a solid, accurate,
exhaustive book; but he has written pleasantly on
"British Novelists and their Styles" and "Drummond
of Hawthornden," besides sundry other
books. Many of our poets have had capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
biographers. Professor Knight of St Andrews has
devoted himself for many years to Wordsworth,
and has written his biography besides editing
his collected works. The late James Dykes
Campbell (1835-1894) wrote a biography of
Coleridge distinguished by remarkable thoroughness.
Professor W. J. Courthope has proved
himself Pope's best biographer and editor, and is
giving us a good "History of English Poetry,"
which at present reaches only to the Reformation.
Mr Churton Collins, one of the most thorough of
our critics, has written on Swift, as has also Sir
Henry Craik; and Swift's life in Ireland has been
gracefully sketched by Mr Richard Ashe King, a
novelist whose "Love the Debt" and "The Wearing
of the Green" have commanded a large audience.
Swift has been a favourite subject with the
biographers. A life of him was the task upon which
<b>John Forster</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1812-1876</b></span> was engaged at the time of his death.
Forster was an untiring biographer, and he benefited
literature as well by his death as by his life, in
that he bequeathed his fine library of books and
manuscripts to the nation. John Forster wrote a
Life of Walter Savage Landor, another of Goldsmith,
and another of Charles Dickens, against
which it was urged that he had introduced too
much of his own personality. Perhaps Forster's
best work was his "Life of Sir John Eliot," an
expansion of a biography of that patriot which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
had contributed to his "Statesmen of the Commonwealth."</p>

<p class="p2">Biography is the great medium of instruction
and inspiration of that little band of Positive
philosophers who accept their gospel from
Auguste Comte, whose "Philosophie Positive"
they have translated into English. "Study the
'Philosophie Positive' for yourself," says George
Henry Lewes, who, with George Eliot, had much
enthusiasm for the new cult; "study it patiently,
give it the time and thought you would not grudge
to a new science or a new language; and then,
whether you accept or reject the system, you will
find your mental horizon irrevocably enlarged.
'But six stout volumes!' exclaims the hesitating
aspirant: Well, yes; six volumes requiring to be
meditated as well as read. I admit that they 'give
pause' in this busy bustling life of ours; but if
you reflect how willingly six separate volumes of
philosophy would be read in the course of the year
the undertaking seems less formidable. No one
who considers the immense importance of a
doctrine which will give unity to his life, would
hesitate to pay a higher price than that of a year's
study." Among the most gifted of the Positivists
is <b>Frederic Harrison</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1831-</b></span>, whose "Order and Progress,"
and "Choice of Books," are well known. Among
his companions in literary and religious warfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
have been <b>James Cotter Morison</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1831-1888</b></span>, who wrote
biographies of St Bernard of Clairvaux and Macaulay,
"The Service of Man" which was a contribution
to religious propaganda; and Richard
Congreve (born 1818), who was a pupil of Dr
Arnold at Rugby, and who has written many
thoughtful political tracts.</p>

<p>An attempt to popularise Comte by an abridgment
of his great work was made by <b>Harriet
Martineau</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1802-1876</b></span>, who was born at Norwich, and was
one of the most versatile of Victorian writers.
None of her work has stood the test of time,
perhaps because she had so little of real genius,
although possessed undoubtedly of great intellectual
endowments. Not the less readily should
we recognise that she exercised considerable influence
upon her own generation. She wrote
many stories dealing with social subjects, and
tales illustrative of Political Economy, which dispersed
many a popular illusion. In a visit to
America she learned to sympathise with the
Northern States, and perhaps no writer of the
day did so much in England to excite sympathy
with the cause which ultimately proved victorious.
Miss Martineau's "Biographical Sketches" were
originally published in the <i>Daily News</i>, a journal
to which she was for many years a regular contributor,
and for which she wrote her own obituary
notice. Her historical work is mere compilation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
destitute alike of originality and thoroughness, and
the greater part of her other work has proved to be
ephemeral. Such tales, however, as "Deerbrook"
and "The Hour and the Man" have still admiring
readers. The publication of her "Letters on the
Laws of Man's Nature and Development" (1851)
excited much controversy, although her fearless
honesty won the respect even of her opponents.</p>

<p>A writer who distinguished himself most notably
at one period by a combination of antagonism to
Supernatural Christianity, and a gift for writing
biography, was <b>John Morley</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-</b></span>. Mr Morley was
born at Blackburn, and educated at Cheltenham
and at Lincoln College, Oxford. Much of his
work was done in journalism; he edited in succession
the <i>Morning Star</i>, the <i>Literary Gazette</i>,
the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
and <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>. He resigned the
editorship of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> in 1883,
when he entered Parliament as member for
Newcastle-on-Tyne, and he gave up his post on
<i>Macmillan's Magazine</i> on entering a Liberal
Cabinet in 1886. He still edits the "English Men
of Letters Series," a remarkable collection of
handy biographies, for which he wrote a "Life
of Burke." His literary achievement, apart from
his essays, is entirely biographical, but it was
of enormous influence upon the intellectual
development of thoughtful young men at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Universities during the seventies and eighties. He
has written lives of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot,
which throw much light on the period prior to
the French Revolution, and give abundant evidence
that, had he not devoted himself to politics
he would have been able to produce a history of
the French Revolution of inestimable value. On
the other hand his "Life of Cobden" was a failure
from a literary standpoint. The essay "On Compromise"
is a most interesting development of
the fundamental idea of Milton's "Areopagitica,"
and is probably the most exhaustive treatment of
the question&mdash;how far we are justified in keeping
back the expression of our opinions in deference to
the views and customs of our fellow-men.</p>

<p>Another good biographer who gave up to Parliament
time which might have been better employed,
from the point of view of a lover of letters,
is <b>Sir George Otto Trevelyan</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1838-</b></span>, whose life of his
uncle, Lord Macaulay, is a delightful biography,
full of entertainment for the most frivolous of
readers. Not less entertaining is Sir George
Trevelyan's "Early History of Charles James Fox"
(1880), a book which makes one wish that the
writer had devoted himself to that epoch of our
history, and had done for the period of the Georges
what his uncle had done for their immediate
predecessors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p><b>Lord Houghton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1885</b></span> wrote poetry as Richard
Monckton Milnes, and his lines are still frequently
quoted. But his biography of Keats&mdash;"Life,
Letters, and Literary Remains of John
Keats (1848)," although not now in any publisher's
list, is certain to be long remembered. Lord
Houghton's life was written by his friend, Sir
Wemyss Reid, author also of a "Monograph on
Charlotte Brontë." His son, after serving as Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, became Earl of Crewe; his
daughter, Florence Henniker, keeps alive the
literary tradition of the family, and is known as a
writer of short stories. Lord Houghton had a
genuine love of letters and of the society of literary
men. So also had <b>Henry Crabb Robinson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1775-1867</b></span>, whose
diary edited by Dr Sadler (1869) brings one in
touch with all the literary men and women of the
period. At his house in Russell Square Robinson
gave breakfasts, to which it became a distinction
to be invited. <b>Samuel Rogers's</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1763-1855</b></span> breakfasts have
been described in many memoirs. Rogers wrote
all his poems long years before the Queen began
to reign, but he lived for another thirty years with
the reputation of a good conversationalist and
story-teller. His "Table Talk" was published in
1856, and it is full of good stories. Two valuable
books concerning Rogers have been written
by Mr Peter William Clayden, "Early Life of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Samuel Rogers," and "Rogers and His Contemporaries."</p>

<p class="p2">An important biography was written by <b>James
Spedding</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1810-1881</b></span>, whose whole life was devoted to a
study of Bacon, and to a thorough destruction of
Macaulay's criticism upon the great philosopher.
The "Letters and the Life of Francis Bacon,
including all his Occasional Works, newly collected
and set forth, with a Commentary Biographical
and Historical," was published in seven
volumes between 1857 and 1874.</p>

<p class="p2">Two of the most notable political philosophers
of the era were George Cornewall Lewis and
Bagehot. <b>Sir George Lewis</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1806-1863</b></span> held important
posts in the Governments of his day, being at
one time Home Secretary and at another Secretary
of State for War. He wrote "A Dialogue
on the Best Form of Government" and many
other treatises. <b>Walter Bagehot</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1826-1877</b></span> was one of the
greatest authorities of his day on banking and
finance. He wrote "Physics and Politics,"
"Economic Studies," and several other works
which have little relation to literature; but
his "Literary Studies" indicated a critical acquaintance
with the best books. A brilliant
publicist of our day, who combines, like Bagehot,
a love of affairs with keen literary instincts, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<b>Goldwin Smith</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1823-</b></span>, who has made his home in
Toronto, Canada, for many years now, but who
was once intimately associated with Oxford University.
Goldwin Smith has written many books
and pamphlets, one on "The Relations between
England and America," another on "The Political
Destiny of Canada," and he has written a short
biography of Cowper.</p>

<p class="p2">The most famous traveller of the reign and one
of our greatest men of letters was <b>George Borrow</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1881</b></span>,
who went to Spain as an agent of the British
and Foreign Bible Society. Hence his "Bible in
Spain," which has become one of the most popular
books in our language as it is one of the most
fascinating. It was first published in 1843 under
the title "The Bible in Spain, or Journeys,
Adventures, and Imprisonments of an Englishman
in an attempt to circulate the Scriptures in
the Peninsula." "Lavengro" (1851) and "The
Romany Rye" (1857) have enjoyed almost an
equal popularity with "The Bible in Spain."</p>

<p class="p2">Herman Melville (1819-1891) was an American
citizen, and his work, therefore, does not
come within the scope of this volume. I am the
more sorry for this, that I consider Melville's
name is entitled to rank with that of George
Borrow as one of the two travellers during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
epoch whose books make literature. It is small
disparagement to the majority of our great travellers
that they have not been men of letters, that
their books, although serviceable to their generation,
are of little moment considered from the
standpoint of art. Although Mr H. M. Stanley,
Dr Nansen, and other adventurous spirits of our
time, may be quite as important in the general
drift of the world's doings as any of the literary
men whose names are contained in this volume,
their books have no place whatever in literature.
It is noteworthy, however, that books written by
travellers have been, during the past ten years
or more, by far the most popular form of reading,
apart from fiction. Interest in historical study
and speculative writing seems to have declined;
interest in travel is as marked as ever.</p>

<p class="p2">The journalism of the reign has been so intimately
associated with literature that were my
space more ample I should have chosen to devote
a chapter to that subject alone. Many of the men
I have mentioned, perhaps most of them, have at
one time or another contributed to the journals or
magazines of the day. Even the novelists have a
peculiar interest in journalism, because of late
years as large a proportion of their pecuniary
reward has come from what is called serial
publication in this or that magazine or newspaper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
as from book publication. Apart from fiction,
access to magazines and newspapers has become,
if it has not always been, an easy and pleasant way
of making oneself heard upon the subject nearest
to one's heart. Literary journalists, who have
afterwards republished their contributions in
volume form include Sydney Smith and John
Wilson at the beginning of the reign; as
also Douglas Jerrold, Mark Lemon, Edmund
Yates, Charles Mackay, and George Augustus
Sala. <b>Sydney Smith</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1771-1845</b></span> left nothing that we can
read to-day. He lives as a pleasant memory. We
know that he must have been a liberal-minded, as
he was certainly a very witty clergyman. He wrote
on "The Ballot" in 1837 and on "The Church
Bills" in 1838, and he went on writing zealously
until his death. "The Wit and Wisdom of Sydney
Smith" was published in 1861. <b>John Wilson</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1785-1854</b></span> has
a more purely literary record. As editor of <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, he made that publication a power
in the land. His "Recreations of Christopher
North" appeared in 1842. Many of his essays
and sketches may still be read with real pleasure,
and indeed his influence will be very much alive
for many a year to come. <b>Douglas Jerrold</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1803-1857</b></span> is also
well known to-day by his "Black-eyed Susan"
and "Mrs Caudle's Curtain Lectures." His son,
Blanchard Jerrold (1826-1884), wrote his life.
<b>Mark Lemon</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1809-1870</b></span> was one of the first editors of <i>Punch</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
newspaper. His hundreds of articles and many
novels are all well nigh forgotten, but his name will
always receive honourable mention in the history
of journalism. <b>Edmund Yates</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1831-1894</b></span>, who founded <i>The
World</i> newspaper in 1874, will be remembered by
his well written "Autobiography"&mdash;one of the
best books of the kind ever issued. Yates wrote
many novels, but they have all passed out of
memory. <b>Charles Mackay</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1814-1889</b></span> was an active journalist
for a number of years. He wrote novels, poems,
and criticisms, and an entertaining autobiography
entitled "Forty Years' Recollections of Life, Literature,
and Public Affairs." Dr Mackay was father
of Eric Mackay, author of "Love Letters of a
Violinist," and stepfather of Miss Marie Corelli
the novelist. <b>George Augustus Sala</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1828-1895</b></span>, who wrote
so continuously for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and other
journals, was also author of many books as well
as the inevitable autobiography. "The Land of
the Golden Fleece," "America Revisited," and
"Living London" are well known. <b>Richard
Jefferies</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1848-1887</b></span> published his "Gamekeeper at Home"
in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. "Wood Magic" (1881),
"Bevis" (1882), and "The Story of My Heart"
(1883), are his best books.</p>

<p class="p2">These names suggest a hundred others. The
most honoured journalist of to-day is <b>Frederick
Greenwood</b> (<b>1830-</b> ), who has edited "The Cornhill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Magazine" and more than one newspaper. He
has written poems, stories, and essays, his
"Lover's Lexicon" and "Dreams" being two
of his latest volumes.</p>

<p>Another editor of <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>, <b>James
Payn</b> (<b>1830-</b> ), has written many successful novels, of which
"Lost Sir Massingberd" (1864) and "By Proxy"
(1878) are perhaps the most popular. Mr Payn's
many accomplishments, his delightful humour and
gift of genial anecdote, have endeared him to a
wide circle.</p>

<p>A journalist of equal distinction was <b>Richard
Holt Hutton</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1826-1897</b></span>, the editor of the <i>Spectator</i>, who in
that journal maintained for thirty-five years the
high-water mark of dignified and independent
criticism, in an age in which the extensive intercourse
of authors and critics, the constant communication
between the writers of books and
the writers for newspapers, has made independent
criticism a difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible
achievement. Mr Hutton wrote many
books, two of the most notable being "Essays
Literary and Speculative," which were full of
thoughtful and discerning estimates of the works
of Wordsworth, George Eliot, and other writers.</p>

<p class="p2">Memoirs abound in the epoch, although we
are mainly indebted to translations. Amiel's
"Journal," translated by Mrs Humphry Ward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
"Marie Bashkirtseff's Diary," translated by
Mathilde Blind, reflect one side of this literary
taste; while the thousand and one memoirs concerning
Napoleon I. represents another. The
most popular series of political memoirs in
English we owed to <b>Charles Cavendish Fulke
Greville</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1794-1865</b></span>, who became Clerk to the Privy Council
in 1821, and held that post until 1860. After
his death his diary was edited by Mr Henry
Reeve. The first series of the "Greville Memoirs"
dealing with the reign of George IV. and
William IV., appeared in 1875 and created immense
excitement.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The later volumes excited
less interest.</p>

<p class="p2">"The Life of the late Prince Consort" (1874) by
<b>Sir Theodore Martin</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1816-</b></span>, naturally contained no
indiscretions although it did much to enhance,
if that were possible, kindly memories of the
Queen's husband. Sir Theodore Martin made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
his first fame under the pseudonym of Bon
Gaultier. His "Book of Ballads," written in conjunction
with Professor Aytoun, had much success.
Sir Theodore Martin also wrote Aytoun's
"Memoir" (1867), and "The Life of Lord
Lyndhurst" (1883). He has translated the Odes
of Horace, "The Vita Nuova" of Dante, Goethe's
"Faust," and Heine's "Poems and Ballads." In
1885 he published a "Sketch of the Life of
Princess Alice."</p>

<p class="p2">It is difficult to know where to place <b>Sir Arthur
Helps</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1817-1875</b></span>, who wrote plays, novels, histories, and
essays. He was an overrated writer in his time.
He is perhaps underrated now. Two series of
"Friends in Council" appeared, the first in 1847,
the second in 1859. They dealt with all manner
of abstract subjects, such as "war," "despotism,"
and so on, and were very popular. Another
volume, "Companions of my Solitude," was
equally successful. Helps was rash enough to
enter into competition with Prescott in treating
of the Spanish Conquest of America; but the
picturesque books of the earlier writer are still
with us while Helps's "Life of Pizarro" (1869)
and "Life of Cortes" (1871) are almost forgotten.
That also is the fate of his romance, "Realmah"
(1868) and of his tragedies, "Catherine Douglas"
and "Henry II." Sir Arthur Helps was Clerk to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the Privy Council, and he edited the "Principal
Speeches and Addresses of the late Prince Consort"
(1862).</p>

<p class="p2">Sir Arthur Helps also edited for <b>Queen Victoria</b><span class="sidenote"><b>1819-</b></span>
her "Leaves from a Journal of our Life in the
Highlands" (1868). The Queen has also published
"The Early Days of His Royal Highness
the Prince Consort" (1867), and "More Leaves from
the Journal of our Life in the Highlands" (1884).</p>

<p>Her Majesty has been credited with a genuine
taste for letters, and a love for good poetry and
good fiction. With some show of authority it
has been stated that her favourite novelists are
Sir Walter Scott, Miss Austen, and Miss Brontë;
while it is quite evident to the least inquisitive that
many literary theologians have had some measure
of her regard. Happily the times have long
passed when literature needed the patronage of
the powerful. To-day it can honourably stand
alone. But it is pleasing to remember that the
sovereign whose sixty years of rule make so remarkable
a record in literature, as in many other
aspects of the world's progress, has taken a sympathetic
interest in the books and bookmen of the
epoch.</p>

<p class="p2">The Queen will have seen reputations blaze
forth and flicker out ignominiously; she will have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
seen many a writer hailed for immortal to-day
and forgotten to-morrow. She will have seen,
however, a succession of writers, Browning and
Tennyson, Carlyle and Ruskin, most notable of
all, who in their impulse towards high ideals
of human brotherhood, in their enthusiasm of
humanity, have given us a literature without a
parallel in history; and she will not be without a
sense of gratification that that literature will go
down the ages bearing the name of Victorian.

<p class="center">With Illustrations by Harold Piffard.</p>
<hr class="l15" />

<p class="center"><i>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</i></p>

<p>"This volume proves beyond all doubt that Mr Hocking has
mastered the art of the historical romancist. 'The Birthright' is, in
its way, quite as well constructed, as well written, and as full of incident
as any story that has come from the pen of Mr Conan Doyle
or Mr Stanley Weyman."&mdash;<i>The Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"We read Mr Hocking's book at a sitting; not because we had
any leisure for the task, but simply because the book compelled us....
We hold our breath as each chapter draws to an end, yet cannot
stop there, for the race is unflagging.... We congratulate Mr
Hocking upon his book, for it is a great advance upon anything he
has done. We prophesy a big public for 'The Birthright.'"&mdash;<i>The
Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"'The Birthright' will be appreciated on account of its successions
of exciting scenes, its crisp dialogue, its play of varied character, and
a certain eerie air of superstition with which it is pervaded....&mdash;<i>The
Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>"A thoroughly enjoyable romance.... Mr Hocking has woven
a story which few will lay down unfinished. The interest never
flags for a moment, and the faithfulness with which the scenery of the
land of Tre, Pol and Pen is described, and the quaint dialect and
traditions of its older inhabitants are reproduced, is beyond praise."&mdash;<i>Weekly
Times.</i></p>

<p>"We feel certain that, were we still condemned to go to bed at
nine, we should sleep with the book under our pillow, and wake with
the birds to see what happened.... A capital story of its class."&mdash;<i>The

<p>"Fancy a woman ... so gifted, sitting down with the resolve to
crush into a few words the infinite tale of all the whole race of her
sex can suffer, and you have an idea of what this remarkable book is
like.... As wonderful an epitome of a world of sorrow as I have
ever read."</p>

<p>"A work of great charm, over which one likes to linger, and
dream, and think.... The words flow with that tuneful felicity
which belongs more to poetry than to prose."&mdash;<i>Liverpool Post.</i></p>

<p>"The five short, poignant stories which make up this excellent
little book, are remarkable for distinction of style, and interesting
by reason of the writer's observation of life and character, and the
originality of her reflections.... Miss Watson can tell a story in a
way to cut the reader to the heart.... The reader of sensibility
will find a chastened pleasure in every one of them."&mdash;<i>The Morning.</i></p>

<p>"So real is this first sketch, so human, so sensitively delicate, so
successful in its curious mingling of boldness and tenderness, that the
reader necessarily imagines it to be autobiographical, believing that
only out of actual sorrow could be distilled so true a record of passion
and of regret."&mdash;<i>The Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>"Written in most admirable prose, this collection of five beautiful,
though sad stories, will appeal to all lovers of good literature....
It adds to its worth as a clever book the additional charm of being a
good one."&mdash;<i>Lloyd's Newspaper.</i></p>

<p>"Such a delightfully natural love story is this that even staid old
people who have not read one for a score of years will admit that it is
quite unromantic enough to be sensible.... We close the book with
a feeling of gratitude to the author who has supplied us with such a
delightful study."&mdash;<i>Manchester Courier.</i></p>

<p>"A delightful little work.... Mr Lee knows these fisher folk by
heart, and has the ability to draw them to the life in a few bright
strokes of drollery.... The character sketching is admirable, the
scenes and situations are most vividly brought out, and the pervading
humour is of a genuine stamp."&mdash;<i>Sheffield Independent.</i></p>

<p>"An entertaining story.... A clever, humorous and thoroughly
enjoyable book."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"A fascinating book.... From beginning to end it is delightfully
fresh and vigorous; the vignettes of Cornish life and character are
quaint and humorous; and the snatches of unsophisticated philosophy,
not without a dash of subtlety, are as amusing as they are original....
Nothing so deliciously witty as John Trehill's courtship has been
written of late, and another story from the author's pen will be awaited
with the keenest pleasure and interest."&mdash;<i>Dundee Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"The story, simple and homely in its nature, is told with a humour
and abandon that makes the book most delightful reading."&mdash;<i>Glasgow
Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>"The book is one to read, having the blessed quality of making
you chuckle: the best of qualities in literature, one is inclined to say,
in these tired days."&mdash;<i>Black and White.</i></p>

<p class="center b15">By A. St John Adcock.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>"This is a remarkable book. It is a collection of short stories on
East End life, but they are told with that real realism of observation
of which Mr Morrison has set the fashion. The setting is real, the
slang is real, the manners and customs seem to have been drawn from
life."&mdash;<i>The Daily News.</i></p>

<p>"It does not need any actual experience of East End life to tell the
reader of these 'East End Idylls' that they are the work of a master-hand....
The little idylls are all exquisitely done&mdash;exquisitely, we
say, because there is no other word which will do full justice to the
performance."&mdash;<i>The Sun.</i></p>

<p>"Very vivid sketches of the East End as it is to-day. In the intimacy
they display with life in the slums, and in the terseness and
force of their style, they boldly challenge comparison with 'Tales of
Mean Streets,' nor do they lose by the comparison. Mr Adcock's
themes are less gloomy and hopeless than Mr Morrison's. Amid all
the misery he loves to recount deeds of unselfish devotion and simple
heroism; nor do I believe that he is less true to life because his realism
is less grim."&mdash;<i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Distinctly a book worth reading. There is heroism here, and
knowledge&mdash;true insight, in fact&mdash;and sympathy."&mdash;<i>The Leeds
Mercury.</i></p>

<p>"A series of touching and delightful sketches. Much has been
written of the East End, but rarely with more charm or sympathy
than by Mr Adcock."&mdash;<i>The Star.</i></p>

<p>"Mr Adcock possesses a graphic pen, and has sketched the loves
and hates, the joys and the sorrows of the dwellers in London's mighty
East in a series of short, vigorous stories that make up a very delightful
volume."&mdash;<i>Lloyd's Newspaper.</i></p>

in the book, which is in every respect eminently readable, making no
heavy demands on the reader, and keeping him in good humour."&mdash;<i>The

<p>"Brightly written stories of the sea.... The stories have a
brightness and freshness which cannot fail to give pleasure."&mdash;<i>Manchester

a sure tonic against business worries and city soot. It has the same
effect as a whip of salt spray on the face of a jaded worker."&mdash;<i>N. B.

<p>"The author writes with strength and picturesqueness on a subject
of which he is evidently a master, and one cannot read his stories
without a thrill of the excitement that is one of the greatest charms
of yachting."&mdash;<i>Dundee Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"A charming volume in all respects.... A more delightful story,
or better told, than 'The Voyage of the Florette' there could not be.
We envy those who have not read it. The book is full of life and

<p>"Mr Langbridge's novel is one which will be read with unmixed
pleasure. It is sprightly and often amusing, reproducing the talk of
Irish peasants and Irish editors. It is also pathetic as it gives us with
much sympathy and good taste a picture of an Irish rector in sickness
and sorrow.... Narrated by Mr Langbridge in a manner that holds
the interest of the reader from beginning to end. Bridget is one of the
raciest characters in recent fiction, and a novel at once so healthy and
so pleasant should be heartily welcomed."&mdash;<i>British Weekly.</i></p>

'A Pilgrim in the Unseen,' and may rival the great popularity of that
striking fancy.... A book of signal literary beauty, of profound
tenderness, and deeply reverent throughout; the work of a man who
finds in earth and heaven alike the sign and token of the Cross."&mdash;<i>The

exalted phantasy never ring false, and his work cannot fail to inspire
the reader with reverence for ideals undreamed of in worldly philosophy."&mdash;<i>The

<p>"An allegory worthy to rank among the greatest achievements of
that form of literature.... The great gospel of love and hope shines
out from these splendid pages.... 'The House of Dreams' is a
book which religious teachers will find it abundantly worth their
while to study."&mdash;<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>"It is in truth a prose poem, one of the most beautiful and delightful
we have ever read.... Nothing could be better than that the
leaders of all Churches should breathe the pure and tender atmosphere
of 'The House of Dreams,' and carry it with them into the world of
daily reality."&mdash;<i>Methodist Times.</i></p>

<p>"A vision of extraordinary force and significance.... It seems to
us that no thoughtful reader will be likely to rise from a perusal of
this book without feeling himself heartened, so inspiring are certain
of its passages.... It is full of high suggestion, of pathos, and of
poetry."&mdash;<i>The Literary World.</i></p>

<p>Dr <span class="smcap">Alfred Russel Wallace</span> says:&mdash;"You have done a service to
the cause of humanity in publishing it, and the author in writing it.
That such things as Mr Sherard describes should exist at the very
end of the century, when all our public writers are boasting of our
wealth, our progress, and our civilisation, is a sufficient proof that
our so-called civilisation is rotten to the core, worse in many respects
than it has ever been before."</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Hall Caine</span> says:&mdash;"The appalling revelations of Robert
Sherard in his recent book are enough to make a man's heart bleed
for the awful sufferings of women in the bitter struggle for bread.
On the fate of our women, especially our working women, the future
of our country, I truly believe, depends; and it is amazing that
Parliament and the Press, and, above all, the Church, have hitherto
given so little attention to so great a problem."</p>

<p>Few names in the Christian ministry are held in such honour as is
accorded by earnest Christian men and women of every sect to that of
the Rev. F. B. Meyer, who has an enormous audience outside his own
church. Hence the announcement of a new volume of Sermons by
him will be peculiarly welcome, and all the more so for the fact that
this is a book which is intended, not for the few, but for the work-a-day
many, for whose encouragement and consolation Mr Meyer has
here given the very fine gold of his thoughts upon spiritual things
and upon the intimate association which exists&mdash;or should exist&mdash;between
the things of the work-a-day life and the higher life.</p>

<p>The announcement of a new book&mdash;and especially of a new book of
a peculiarly Le Galliennesque and characteristic description by the
author of "The Book-Bills of Narcissus," "The Religion of a Literary
Man," and "Prose Fancies," will be received with very eager and unusual
interest. Whatever may be the opinions entertained by individual
readers about Mr Le Gallienne's own views, there is no denying
that no book by him has yet appeared which has not aroused exceptional
interest and exceptional discussion. His last venture is likely
to be even more universally talked about. It is a greatly-daring but
extremely beautiful and reverent attempt to deal with the terrible
problem of the presence of moral and physical evil, but quite apart
from its value as a contribution to the philosophy of life, it is a singularly
striking and beautiful piece of literary work, full of the exquisite
imaginings and lovely fancies of the accomplished poet and
man of letters.</p>

<p class="center b15">By E. Phipps Train</p>

<p class="center">Author of "A Social Highwayman," etc.</p>

<p>This is a book which, with ordinary luck, should bid fair to rival
the popularity of "Called Back" or "Mr Barnes of New York." From
first to last it is enthrallingly interesting, and dealing, as it does, with
the life "behind the scenes" of a great dancer who is the "darling"
of her public, it gives its readers a peep into a world of which little
is known by outsiders. Rarely have the trials and temptations, the
thousand and one cares and anxieties of those whose business it is
always to wear a smiling face, in order that they may entertain their
public, been drawn with such skill and vividness.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
